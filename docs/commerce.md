# Commerce — what is sold, where the goods list lives, and why no price table exists

Answers **G21** ("what does each shop stock, and at what price"). Grades per
`AGENTS.md` § 5. Nothing here quotes dialogue verbatim into git beyond the short
catalogue labels needed to identify a shop; the strings are game content and stay
described rather than reproduced.

## 1. There is no goods table and no price table

**measured negative, with a stated limit.** Every shop catalogue in the executable is an
**inline string** printed via the string-output routine (call target `L_0051df`; the
routines are `asm/4FDF_str_out`, `asm/51EB_str_out_at`, `asm/51FD_str_out_core`), not a
record in a table. The four `shop_header_*` routines are 13-byte label printers that fall
through to whatever follows:

```
shop_header_weapons:
        call L_0051df
        db "WEAPONS: ",0x00
```

A full printable-string survey of `original/ultimaii.exe` (548 strings of 5+ chars,
runtime address = file offset − `0x200` per `captures/README.md:33`) returns 47
commerce-related hits, and every one is a message or a catalogue label. No array of
(item, price) pairs was found in any of them.

**The limit, stated plainly:** this is a survey of printable strings plus the shop
routines, not an exhaustive proof that no numeric price table exists anywhere in 37 KB.
What would settle it: walking the arithmetic in each shop routine and showing every price
is a computed immediate. The tavern already shows exactly that (§ 3).

## 2. What each shop sells

| shop | catalogue | where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weapons | 8 items, two-letter abbreviations (DA, MA, AX, BO, SW, GR, LI, PH) | `1E69`/`1E81` |
| Armour | 6 items: CLOTH, LEATHER, CHAIN, PLATE, REFLECT, POWER | `1D39`/`1D56` |
| Magic | 6 spells, **two different lists** (see below) | `189E`/`18B7`, `19EC`/`1A05` |
| Horse dealer | one item, price quoted then a yes/no deal | `1F93`/`1FC4` |
| Clue seller | one clue, price chosen by the player × 100 | `1B02` |
| Tavern | buy a drink, or tip | `15FC`/`1654` |
| Cleric | accepts a gold offering | `asm/3C2E_cmd_O` |

**The two spell lists are the one real per-town difference.** One ends
`4-PASS, 5-SURFACE, 6-PRAYER`, the other `4-M.M., 5-BLINK, 6-KILL`; the first three
spells are identical. So magic shops differ in their high tier. **inferred** — the
strings exist, but nothing has yet shown which town selects which list. That is the
follow-up worth doing, and it is answerable statically by finding the branch.

The same weapon and armour catalogue text appears **twice**: once in the shop and once in
the use-command (`cmd_W` reuses the armour list). So a shop and a command share strings;
do not read a second occurrence as a second shop.

## 3. Prices are computed inline, not stored

The tavern is the worked example. On `1-BUY` the routine sets a 16-bit value at
`DS:27/28` to **5** (`mov $0x5,%al; mov %al,0x28` / `mov $0x0,%al; mov %al,0x27`) before
printing the price. The clue seller asks the player to type an amount and multiplies it
by 100. Neither reads a table.

Gold income is separate and already named: `asm/2D8C_combat_kill_reward` prints
`KILLED--GOLD+`, so kills award gold directly.

## 4. Street NPCs do not transact

Seven `street_*` handlers exist — guard, jester, merchant, fighter, cleric, wizard, thief
(`asm/40E0`–`asm/41D9`). Three of them have commerce-flavoured lines and **none of them
sells anything**: the merchant offers apples (`asm/412C`), the thief offers a watch
(`asm/41D9`), the guard demands taxes (`asm/40E0`). All three are fixed strings with no
purchase path. Bytes are proven; none of the three appears in `ExecutedInstructions` in
any of the 60 harvests, so the trigger conditions are unobserved.

## 5. Why G21 was never answered — a boundary defect

`asm/19D7_magic_shop_menu.asm` declares `# func 19D7..2027`, **0x651 bytes**, and
contains **59 strings**, including the armour shoppe (`1D20`), the weapons shoppe
(`1E52`), the horse shoppe (`1F93`) and the clue seller (`1B02`).

That is at least four distinct shop routines inside one file named after one of them.
Anyone searching for "the shop code" finds a file labelled *magic shop menu* and stops.
**This is why the commerce subsystem looked unmapped — it was not unmapped so much as
filed under the wrong name.**

Splitting it is a Phase 2/3 function-boundary change, which touches the byte-proof
harness, so it is **recorded as a defect and not done here.** It needs the owner's
go-ahead and a per-function `check_func.py` run for each new range.

## 6. Follow-ups

| item | note |
| --- | --- |
| Find the branch that selects between the two spell catalogues | static, answers whether magic shops differ per town |
| Walk each shop routine's arithmetic to confirm every price is computed | closes the § 1 limit |
| Split `asm/19D7` into its real routines | boundary change, needs approval + `check_func.py` per range |
| Observe a real purchase | none of the shop routines appears in any harvest; all behaviour here is static |
