## Gate log

- **2026-10-27 — CP0 🔒 AWAITING OWNER ARCHITECTURE APPROVAL.** Built and
  tested; nothing here is irreversible and no gate criterion was loosened.
  Decisions needing sign-off before CP1 builds on them:
  1. **Seam layer as the only platform boundary** — `src/core/seam.h` wraps the
     four vtables in `src/platform/platform.h`; game code never touches a
     backend directly. Every seam call traces with its asm address.
  2. **DS state as an offset-asserted struct** (`src/core/state.h`) rather than
     a bag of accessors; CS-side statics stay with their owning module.
     Reference correction found while building it: `DS:0x2E` is the **column**
     and `DS:0x2F` the **row** (`asm/51FD_str_out_core.asm` loads DL from
     0x2E, DH from 0x2F, BH=0); plan §1 lists them as "page/col".
  3. **Determinism by clock substitution** — headless swaps in a virtual clock,
     which makes `rand_byte` (tick-derived in the original) replayable. No RNG
     is invented; the unproven tail of `rand_byte` is deferred to its first
     caller.
  4. **Selfmod premise retired** — the cluster's executed bytes match the
     static image in all 45 captures; CP3 no longer depends on a live dump.
     A live DOSBox/Spice86 dump is available as extra confirmation on request.
  5. **Audio stays a stub until CP9** — terminal bell in term mode, silent in
     headless; no system package installed.
  6. **CI gains an engine job** (build + `make test`); Phase 3 jobs unchanged
     and still green.

## Invariants (checked at every checkpoint)

| Check | Command | CP0 result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-function byte proof | `python3 tools/check_func.py <SEG>` | 1299/1299 green (sample re-run + CI) |
| Mechanical rebuild | `bash tools/assemble_all.sh` | byte-identical |
| Clean-tree rebuild | `bash tools/assemble_clean.sh` | 1299/1299 cleaned, 37,344 B identical |
| Original untouched | md5 `fe884d5117971073ac8097cc7a6aca25` | unchanged |
| Engine test | `make -C engine test` | PASS 9/9 |
