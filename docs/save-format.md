# The `player` save file: format, proven fields, and teleporting

Everything currently known about the saved character record, what is proven and
how, and what is still missing. Written 2026-10-21 after building
`tools/u2_edit.py`.

Related: `docs/map-format.md` (sector maps), `docs/tooling-procedures.md`
(driving the emulator), `engine/src/core/state.h` (the DS offset authority).

## Evidence grades used here

| grade | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| proven | assignment or read site cited in `asm/`, or reproduced byte-for-byte |
| measured | observed from a live session, tool and inputs named |
| inferred | reasoned from a partial read; treat as a hypothesis |

## 1. Shape of the file

`player` is **384 bytes**. The interesting part is a 256-byte record that is the
game's DS working segment at `DS:36..135`, stored verbatim:

    save_offset = DS_offset - 0x36

Two independent proofs, and it is worth stressing that they are independent:

* **proven (static, CP2.5):** the creation routine's assignments and the FCB
  read/write sites in `asm/5400` and `asm/3823` establish the 256-byte record at
  `DS:36..135`. See `docs/phase4-implementation.md` § CP2.5.
* **measured (live, 2026-10-21):** loaded the TEST character into Spice86, read
  `DS:36..135` over the HTTP memory API and compared all 256 bytes against the
  file on disk. **254/256 identical.** The two exceptions are `DS:74/75`
  (live `47 3A`, saved `00 00`), which are scratch the game does not persist.

The static proof came first; the live check is corroboration, not a new finding.
That matters because the earlier offset table in `docs/spice86-live-findings.md`
mixes save content with live DS state - `DS:137` onward is the monster table and
is *not* saved.

Bytes `0x100..0x17F` of the file sit outside the record. `0x100` is `0x1A` in
every save examined; the rest read zero. Purpose unknown.

## 2. Proven fields

All offsets below are `DS:` values; subtract `0x36` for the file offset.

| DS | field | notes | grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x36..45` | `name[16]` | cleared then typed, NUL padded | proven |
| `0x46` | `sex` | `'M'`/`'F'` as typed, not converted | proven |
| `0x47` | `pclass` | 0 fighter, 1 mage, 2 paladin, 3 thief (after `sub $0x31`) | proven |
| `0x48` | `race` | 0 human, 1 elf, 2 dwarf, 3 hobbit | proven |
| `0x49` | `sector_first` | first **decimal digit** of the sector filename | proven |
| `0x4A` | `sector_second` | second digit; outside a sector read it is the site kind: 0 overworld, 1 village, 2 town, 4 tower | proven |
| `0x4B..50` | `str agi sta cha wis int` | six stats, one byte each | proven |
| `0x51/52` | `hp` | **4-digit BCD pair**, hundreds byte first | proven + measured |
| `0x53..55` | `food` | 6-digit BCD; the status band prints only the top 4 digits | proven + measured |
| `0x56/57` | `exp` | 2-digit BCD pair | proven |
| `0x58/59` | `gold` | 2-digit BCD pair | proven |
| `0x5A/5B` | `entry_x`, `entry_y` | spawn point; the P path copies `[0x5A]->[0x00]`, `[0x5B]->[0x01]` | proven |
| `0x63` | `spell_pick` | readied spell slot | proven |
| `0x64..135` | **unknown** | inventory and equipment are expected here, not located | unknown |

### BCD, and why HP is not a byte

Several counters are packed decimal: the decimal digits live in the nibbles, so
byte `0x04` means the digits `04`, and `0x99` means `99`.

* Encoding: split the decimal digits into pairs and parse each pair as hex, so
  `400 -> 0x04 0x00` and `9999 -> 0x99 0x99`.
* Decoding: render each byte as two hex characters, then read the resulting
  string as **decimal**. Doing both steps in hex is the classic mistake and
  reports gold `400` as `1024`. It was made here and caught by checking against
  the on-screen `GOLD=0400`.

**`hp` is BCD, not a plain byte.** `hp=4` with `0x52=0` displays as `H.P.=0400`.
Writing a raw `255` puts `0xFF` in the high byte, whose nibbles are not decimal
digits, and the game prints `??` for them - which is exactly what the first
attempt at a maxed character produced. The maximum representable HP is `9999`.

### Sector is two digits, not a number

`DS:49/4A` are patched into the filename `MAPXFF` by `asm/2290`, so sector 20 is
stored as the pair `2, 0`. Reading that pair as an integer yields `512`, which is
a trap that produced a confusing readout before it was understood.

## 3. Teleporting the character

**Writing `DS:00/01` in a live emulator does not teleport.** The write lands and
reads back correctly, but movement then stops working entirely: `DS:00/01` is a
mirror the game updates, not the value it drives movement from. Discovered the
expensive way on 2026-10-21.

The working method is edit-the-save-and-reload, which is also the only way to
change sector:

```bash
python3 tools/u2_edit.py set    <save> sector 71
python3 tools/u2_edit.py setpos <save> 20 20
tools/spice86_start.sh --headless --name run --player <save> --patch-arrows
```

Verified: writing sector digits `1,0` boots the character into sector 10,
confirmed by `DS:49/4A` reading `1,0` and by a screenshot showing completely
different terrain. Combined with `entry_x/y` this is "start anywhere in any
sector", which removes the need to synthesise probe maps for most experiments.

## 4. The maxed test character

Superseded by section 6, which covers the full kit. Kept only for the note that
the stat value used is a conservative "strong", not a proven cap.

## 5. Equipment, consumables and inventory

**Correction, same day.** An earlier draft of this file said the item slots were
not located. They were - already proven and written up in
`docs/spice86-live-findings.md` section 11, which I did not check before
asserting a gap. That is the `AGENTS.md` rule about listing the corpus before
harvesting, broken again, and it produced a confidently wrong doc.

All offsets are `DS:`; the slots are inside the saved record, so they are
editable.

| DS | field | encoding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x61` | readied weapon | index, 0 = HANDS |
| `0x62` | worn armour | index, 0 = SKIN |
| `0x64` / `0x65` / `0x66` | torches / keys / tools | BCD, one byte each |
| `0x6D` | **world byte** — 0 Earth, 1..9 planets, `0x0A` deep space | index. This row used to say `boots count`, which was an artefact of our own editor: `tools/u2_edit.py` defined a `boots` field here and `maxout` wrote 1 into it, and the doc then named the byte after our write. Boots are `items_held[BOOTS]` at `DS:D9`, which is what the paralysis save at runtime `0x22FD` actually reads. See G44 in `docs/needs-gameplay.md` |
| `0x76 + i` | weapons owned | one count per weapon, 10 entries |
| `0xD6 + i` | items held | one count per item, 16 slots |

Name tables, cited to file offsets in `original/ultimaii.exe`:

* weapons at `0x4F53`: `HANDS DAGGER MACE AXE BOW SWORD "GREAT SWORD"
  "LIGHT SWORD" PHASER "QUICK SWORD"`
* armour at `0x4F9E`: `SKIN CLOTH LEATHER CHAIN PLATE REFLECT POWER NONE` -
  eight entries, which is why the damage roll masks `& 7`
* items at `0x501D`: `RING WAND STAFF BOOTS CLOAK HELM GEM ANKH "RED GEM"
  "SKULL KEY" "GREEN GEM" "BRASS BUTTON" "BLUE TASSLE" "STRANGE COIN"
  "GREEN IDOL" TRI-LITHIUM`

The plural handling proves this is the live table: the display appends a literal
`S` (`asm/4881`) but skips index 3, because `BOOTS` is already plural.

**Not independently re-verified this session.** The editor writes these fields and
round-trips them through the file, but the in-game inventory display was not
opened - `I` is not the inventory command, and the correct key is not yet
recorded. The slot identities rest on the earlier value-match proof, not on
today's run.

### What the game actually consumes (measured 2026-10-29)

The owner supplied a consumables table from memory. Every row of it that this binary
can be tested against held, and the one row that initially looked wrong was the row
this project had misfiled. Three things in the whole game are spent on use, and they
do not all live in the same place.

| consumable | where it lives | spent by | grade |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| STRANGE COIN | `items_held[13]` = `DS:E3` | `cmd_N` NEGATE TIME falls into `asm/3C04`, which does `stc ; cmc ; sbb $1,%al ; das ; cmc` and stores back, then writes `0x14` to `DS:26A` (creature-move freeze) | **observed** — `captures/spice86/cmd-nr-live`, coin read back at 0 both sides |
| TRI-LITHIUM | `items_held[15]` = `DS:E5` | space travel: `asm/6999` (whose own label for the slot is `  FUEL=`) and `asm/6DFD` both subtract and store | static — never observed; space is CP7 |
| TOOLS | **`DS:66`, not an item slot** | a dungeon trap: `asm/277B` prints `ARGH! A TRAP!`, reads `DS:66`, prints `ESCAPED! BY USE OF TOOLS!`, and stores the decremented byte. Gained via `asm/2CF6_tools_add_one` | static — dungeons are parked (AGENTS.md § 3); open as **G47** in `docs/needs-gameplay.md`, which lists the four things a dungeon session still has to observe |

**Why TOOLS looked absent, and why that was the project's error and not the owner's.**
The item name table at file `0x501D` has sixteen entries and none of them is TOOLS, so
a scan scoped to `items_held` concludes the game has no such item. It does have one; it
is a packed-decimal counter sitting beside torches (`DS:64`) and keys (`DS:65`), and
`state.h` already names it `tools`. The lesson is that "not in the item table" is a
statement about one array, not about the game.

Everything else in the item array is a read-only gate. A fixed-displacement scan of the
whole binary gives the access profile:

| slot | item | fixed-address accesses | role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `D6` | RING | read 1, write 1 | `asm/24B5`: non-zero prints `RING PROTECTS FROM FIELD!`, zero takes `FIELD CAUSES 1000 DAMAGE!` |
| `D7` | WAND | read 1 | spell focus, `cmd_M` |
| `D8` | STAFF | none | spell focus, `cmd_M` |
| `D9` | BOOTS | none | paralysis resist |
| `DA` | CLOAK | read 1 | resist |
| `DB` | HELM | read 3, write 2 | `cmd_V` world view |
| `DC` / `DE` / `E0` | GEM, RED GEM, GREEN GEM | **none at all** | owner: "essentially junk items". No reader found |
| `DD` | ANKH | read 1 | rocket boarding |
| `DF` | SKULL KEY | read 1 | airplane boarding |
| `E1` | BRASS BUTTON | read 1 | airplane launch |
| `E2` | BLUE TASSLE | read 1 | frigate boarding |
| `E4` | GREEN IDOL | read 1 | resist |

The four boarding keys being read-only is the byte side of G42, which had one live
sample and now has a whole-binary scan behind it.

**Two caveats, and both are the reason this section grades itself.**

1. The table counts *fixed-displacement* accesses only. Indexed forms — `mov 0xd6(%di),%al`
   — are invisible to it, and the game uses them: `asm/2D22` increments a slot by index and
   `asm/0FCD_combat_thief_steal` deletes by index. So "none" for the gems, STAFF and BOOTS
   means "no fixed-address site", and is graded `inferred`, not `measured`.
2. An `asm/`-level grep is not sufficient either. `asm/3C04`'s entire body is stored as
   forced-keep `.byte` lines, so a scan over mnemonics found no STRANGE COIN write at all
   and the first draft of this section said so. The raw-binary scan is what caught it. Same
   class of blindness as `asm/405D` hiding the aim-gate call.

### Disputed: WIS versus CHA

`state.h` labels `DS:4E` `stat_cha` and `DS:4F` `stat_wis`; the live findings
table lists them the other way round. It is not provable from a character where
both are equal. The editor follows `state.h` because `state.h` is the authority,
but the labels for those two bytes should be treated as unsettled until a
character with different values settles it.

## 6. The maxed, fully kitted character

`python3 tools/u2_edit.py maxout <save>` sets stats to 40, `hp` 9999, `food`
999999, `gold` 9999, `exp` 9999, readies QUICK SWORD, wears POWER armour, gives
50 torches, 20 keys, 20 tools, boots, every weapon and one of every item.

Verified live: the loaded character displays `H.P.=9999 FOOD=9999 EXP=9999
GOLD=9999`. The equipment and inventory side is written and round-trips, but see
the verification caveat above.

The stat value 40 is a conservative "strong", **not a proven cap**. The TEST
character's `DS:4B` is `0x50`, which read as BCD is **50** - an earlier draft of
this file called that 80, having read the byte as an integer. Stats are BCD.


## 7. Safety

* `original/` and `references/` are never modified. `u2_edit.py` refuses to edit
  a path under `references/`, and refuses in-place edits under `original/`.
* The game rewrites its own `player` file in the working directory, which is why
  every run uses a per-launch copy under `tmp/`.
* Edits are verified by reading the file back and re-parsing, not by trusting the
  write.

## What a new game is — there is no default game state

Asked directly on 2026-10-23, because CP5 wanted a character to fight with and the
engine's `--play-map` entry was running on a zeroed state. The assumption worth
testing was that the original keeps a stock starting character somewhere.

It does not. **`DS:36` is the first byte of the character name**, and that single
byte is the whole "is there a game yet?" test:

| evidence | grade |
| --- | --- |
| `asm/5400`: `cmp byte [0x36],0` gates the character-creation flow | observed |
| `state.h` declares `/* 0x36 */ uint8_t name[16]` | observed |
| across 107 `player` files harvested from `tmp/` run dirs, `file[0]` equals the first byte of the name in every one: `TEST`→`0x54`, `AIRTEST`→`0x41`, `STRANGER`→`0x53`, `SHOPTEST`→`0x53`, `G23MAX`→`0x47`, `AGENT34`→`0x41`, `ARTTEST`→`0x41`, and `0x00` wherever the name is empty | measured |

The record is the file's first 256 bytes, so `file[0] == DS:36`. The blank `player`
file shipped on the disk is all zeros, which means an empty name, which means
"generate a character". So:

* **a new game is not a state, it is the absence of one** — the creation flow is the
  starting state, and it is reached by the same test on every boot;
* the engine needs no stock character and must not invent one. `u2_save_ensure`
  seeds a missing `PLAYER` from the pristine blank template, which is byte-identical
  to the shipped disk image, and `DS:36 == 0` then routes to creation exactly as the
  original does. Being faithful and being pragmatic are the same code path here,
  which is the sign that the mapping is right;
* `--play-map` now loads the record first, as the title's own `P` path already did
  (`title.c` `run_play`). Before this it entered the world on zeros, so a scripted
  fight could not be shown at all: `agi` 0 never lands a hit, and the sector was
  whatever the zero bytes happened to say.

## 8. The saved window is not the same set as the saved fields (found 2026-10-29)

The record is 256 bytes at `DS:36`, and the game saves that whole span — but some bytes inside
the span are **runtime state that happens to live there**, and they do not survive a round trip
through the original unchanged. The first one measured:

| byte | field | why it is not save state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DS:74/75` | `speed` | `asm/06AC_clock_tick_wait` calibrates it at **every** startup by counting busy passes inside a 20-tick `INT 1Ah` window. The engine has no clock calibration, so its mirror holds 0; the original writes whatever this machine measured. |

Observed directly: the engine wrote `00 00` there, the original loaded the record and its live
`DS:74` read `04 3a` (0x3A04 — the same neighbourhood as the documented 0x3A17 measurement in
`docs/spice86-live-findings.md`). So a byte-for-byte "our file vs the original's memory"
comparison can never be exact across those two bytes, and a harness that demanded it would be
asserting that the engine should fake a clock calibration it does not have.

This matters for anyone writing a save comparison: **exclude by name with a reason, and print
what both sides held.** A tolerance that prints nothing is indistinguishable from a tolerance
that never fired.

## 9. Cross-loading with the original — `tools/save_cross_load.py`

Local, on demand, **not in CI and not in `make test`**. Two reasons, both owner decisions
2026-10-29: it needs `original/` and `references/`, which are gitignored by policy, and
re-running it on every push would be measuring a game binary that has not changed since the
last time it passed.

**Run it when save handling changes**: `engine/src/core/save.c`, the write-back in
`engine/src/core/world.c`, the DS layout in `engine/src/core/state.h`, or the harness itself.

```sh
python3 tools/save_cross_load.py                  # A only, no emulator, a few seconds
python3 tools/save_cross_load.py --with-emulator  # A + B, boots the original, about a minute
```

* **A, original -> engine.** Loads a real record (default `references/ultima2/player`) and
  asserts `DS:36..0x135` matches the file byte for byte. Proves our *reader*.
* **B, engine -> original.** Builds a record with the engine's own reader and writer, boots the
  original with it, presses `ESC`+`P`, and peeks `DS:36..256` out of the live process. Proves
  our *writer* produces a file the real game accepts. It checks the name at `DS:36` first, so a
  green means the original loaded **our** character rather than sitting on a title screen.

Both directions pass as of 2026-10-29. Two things learned doing it, both now encoded in the
harness rather than left as prose:

* the shipped `references/ultima2/player` is the **blank creation template**, and the original
  will not "load previous character" from it — the first attempt read `DS:13 = 0x00` and a blank
  name. Direction B therefore starts from the engine's own seed record, which is the thing under
  test anyway.
* the live peek is read from memory, not from the run dir's `player` file, because the game
  rewrites that file as it plays and it is not a stable witness.

`engine/tests/save_check.c` still owns the byte-format assertions in CI: it runs on
engine-authored filler and proves sizes, offsets and tail preservation. What it cannot prove is
that the real game accepts what we write, and that is the gap this harness closes.

## 10. What the game writes back: the player record, and the outdoors sector (measured 2026-10-29)

**Corrected the same evening.** The first version of this section said the player record was
the only thing the game ever writes. That was wrong, and it was wrong because the save that
would have shown otherwise had silently refused. The full picture, measured with
`captures/spice86/save-wilderness`:

| action | what lands on disk |
| --- | --- |
| crossing a site edge (leave or enter a town) | `mapx`/`monx` byte-identical to pristine — **but that measurement compared the sector files only; see "Open: the site-entry save" below, which may make this row wrong** |
| `Q` outdoors, gate satisfied | `player`, **and `mapxNN` and `monxNN` of the sector you are standing in** |
| `Q` inside a town | refused: `ONLY OUTDOORS!`, nothing written |
| `Q` outdoors with `DS:6D != 0` | refused: `ONLY ON EARTH!`, nothing written |
| **death, any cause** | **nothing.** The zeroing is memory-only |
| **rocket launch from a wilderness sector** | `player` **only** — not `mapxNN`, not `monxNN` |
| **entering a site** (town, tower, dungeon, castle, village) | **probably `player` too — see the open question below, this doc currently says otherwise** |

### The rocket launch saves, silently, and bypasses the save guards

`asm/38B0`'s rocket branch, behind the guard `[DS:6D] == 0 AND [DS:4A] == 0` — Earth *and*
a wilderness sector:

```asm
L_003b52:  mov %al,0x6b      ; DS:6B = y
L_003b55:  mov $0x1,%al
L_003b57:  mov %al,0x69      ; DS:69 = 1
L_003b5a:  call L_0024fd     ; the save body, immediately
```

It calls the save body **directly**, not through `asm/3DFA_offer_only_outdoors_earth`, so
it does not pass the guards that print `ONLY OUTDOORS!` and `ONLY ON EARTH!`. Its own
guard happens to be the same condition, which is why the effect looks like a normal save.

Measured as a controlled pair, same character and same actions, differing only in the
sector the launch happened in:

| run | launch sector | `player` on disk vs the seed given to it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| g62 | **40** wilderness, `DS:4A = 0` | **DIFFERS** — 12 bytes, food `999999` -> `999941` |
| g60 | **41** site sector, `DS:4A = 1` | **IDENTICAL** — the game never wrote it |

And `mapx40`, `monx40`, `mapx41`, `monx41`, `mapx30` were byte-identical to pristine in
**both** runs. So the launch writes the player record and nothing else, which means the
sector write described in the table above is *not* inside `L_0024fd`, or is conditional on
something the launch path does not set. Unresolved, and it matters: two routes into the
same save body write different sets of files.

### Why this is a hazard for a player, not a curiosity

Owner's account, and the bytes we have so far are consistent with it: **entering space
forces a save, so a bad trip is permanent.** The trap is real and it is reachable —
`asm/6DFD` dumps an off-course ship into deep space, `asm/7030` answers `REQUEST DENIED!`
from deep space so you cannot land, and hyperwarp costs one TRI-LITHIUM per jump. Run out
of fuel in deep space and the character is stranded in a game that already wrote the
stranding to disk. Backing up the player file before a launch is not superstition.

The same account says **time-period transitions force a save too**. That half is
`recalled` and not yet found: the five other callers of `L_0024fd` turned out to be
site-entry routines, not time doors, and `docs/moongates.md` does not evidence a
transition save. Where to look is named below.

### Open: the site-entry save, which this doc currently contradicts

`asm/341E` (village), `asm/343F` (`-TOWN`, `-TOWER`), `asm/34B5`/`asm/34CF` (`-CASTLE`)
and `asm/34E4` (`-DUNGEON`) all share one shape — record the return cell, then save:

```asm
mov %al,0x5a    ; DS:5A = entry_x
mov %al,0x5b    ; DS:5B = entry_y
call L_0024fd   ; the save body
```

If that reaches disk, then **every site entry silently saves the game**, and the first row
of the table above ("crossing a site edge writes nothing") is wrong. That row came from
`captures/spice86/save-wilderness`, which measured `mapx`/`monx` byte-identity and may
never have compared `player` against its seed. The test is cheap and is the same A/B used
above: seed in a wilderness sector, walk into a town gate, diff `player` against the seed.
Not yet run. Recorded rather than asserted, because the row it would correct is a measured
row and it deserves a measurement, not an inference from a `call` site.

### Death does not touch the file (measured 2026-11-03)

This needed saying because it was asserted wrongly in session first: "death zeroes the stats
and that zeroed record is what a later save persists". The second half was an inference and
it is false. Two independent measurements:

* **Bytes.** The death tail `asm/0C62..0C99` calls only `L_0052f9` (the H.P. repaint). It does
  not call the save body `L_0024fd`, and neither does any of its four fragments.
* **Disk.** Three runs ended with the character dead — a rocket into water, a rocket into
  forest, and a third session. Every one of their `player` files still reads `hp 9999`,
  `food 999999`, `gold 9999`, `exp 9999`, POWER armour: the untouched seed values, while the
  live memory at the same moment read all zeros.

So death is a **memory-only** event. Restart the program, load, and the character is whole.
What death actually costs you is the session: you keep playing a zero-stat wreck until you do.
The paired correction is that the rocket's `YOU HAVE EXPLODED!` arm (below REFLECT armour,
`asm/6999_space_status`) neither zeroes anything nor returns a prompt — it spins on a
self-jump — but it is no more destructive of the save than death is. Neither can lose a
character permanently, which is worth knowing before anyone writes a walkthrough that says so.

The launch-from-wilderness row is the mirror image: `asm/38B0` calls the save body when
`[DS:6D] == 0` and `[DS:4A] == 0`, so launching a rocket from an Earth wilderness sector
silently writes the game. Observed directly — the run that launched from sector 40 has
`food 999941` on disk where the seed said `999999`, and the runs that ended in death or in a
launch from a site sector still read the seed value.

So the save is real and it does persist the world — but only the **outdoor** sector, and only
when its gate passes. The owner's reading of why, offered before the measurement and borne out
by it: the overworld is the persistent world, and towns and dungeons are instances the game
declines to save at all. That is a design, not an oversight, and it is why "towns reset when
you enter them" is true even though the engine has a working sector store.

What a wilderness save actually wrote, in sector 30, against the pristine file:

* **`mapx30`: 3 cells**, each a creature standing on that cell at the moment of the save —
  `0x0C -> 0x30`, `0x0C -> 0xFC`, `0x08 -> 0x30`. The saved grid is the **stamped** grid, not
  the authored terrain. This is the mechanism behind `docs/map-format.md` § 9's odd fact that
  shipped `mapx` files contain creature art baked into the terrain: somebody saved a game with
  monsters standing there.
* **`monx30`: 15 bytes**, three creature slots (29, 30, 31) that were empty in the shipped
  file and now carry x, y, hp, type and kind. Those are wandering spawns, persisted.

### The engine now implements the guards, and enhanced mode drops them

`u2_overworld_save()` runs all three, in the order the bytes put them, behind `u2_save_policy`
so the save path never branches on fidelity: `U2_SAVE_POLICY_ORIGINAL` refuses, and
`U2_SAVE_POLICY_ENHANCED` (selected by `--enhanced`) allows all three, which is the owner's
"save anywhere" of 2026-10-29. Gate: `engine/tests/save_gate.py`, wired as CP5 V3.

Two things that fell out of implementing it:

* The engine had the outdoors guard and had stubbed the other two as "cannot happen until
  CP6/CP7" — vehicles exist now, and `DS:6D` turned out to be a live byte rather than a planet
  counter. A guard left stubbed because the state that feeds it looked unreachable is a
  standing invitation to this exact mistake.
* Making the on-foot guard real broke `vehicle_board.py`, which observed the tile BOARD leaves
  by saving and reading the sector back — and the original cannot save while aboard a vehicle.
  The gate was not wrong about the rule, only about the route to the disk, so that one case now
  saves under `--enhanced` and says why in its comment. `save_q_check.c` also had to be fixed:
  it hand-rolled a world without the on-foot stamp, which is a state the game cannot be in.


### `DS:6D` is the world byte, and our own tool named it wrong

`DS:6D` is **which world the player is on**: 0 = Earth, 1..9 = the planets, 0x0A = deep space.
`asm/3DFA`'s `ONLY ON EARTH!` is a literal description of the save test, not a metaphor.

The byte was called `boots_count` for two years because of a bug in our own tooling.
`tools/u2_edit.py` defined a `boots` field at `DS:6D` and `maxout` wrote `1` into it, so every
maxed test character was silently standing on planet 1 — and `state.h` then named the field
after the write our editor was making. Boots are `items_held[BOOTS]` at `DS:D9`, which is what
the paralysis resist actually reads. That also retires the `STALE COPY` note that used to sit
against the field: a byte that never was boots did not change when a thief took the boots,
which was never a paradox about the game at all.

The evidence is in `asm/7030_space_collision`, the only writer of the byte in the tree: it
stores `0x0A` beside `YOU ARE IN DEEP SPACE.`, stores a world index beside `YOU ARE ORBITING `,
dispatches on `cmp $0x0`/`$0x1`/`$0x2`…, and answers `cmp $0xa` in the landing path with
`REQUEST DENIED!`. Then `mov 0x6d,%al ; mov %al,0x49` copies it into the sector **tens** digit,
so the world and the high digit of the sector number are the same value. The shipped `player`
record carries `0x00` there — Earth, and therefore savable.

Practical consequence, now fixed: `maxout` no longer writes `DS:6D`, so a maxed character can
save again. Any test character built by an older `maxout` and left on disk is sitting on planet
1 and will refuse `Q` until the byte is cleared with `u2_edit.py set <file> world 0`.

**The sweep was run on 2026-10-29.** 271 save-shaped files were scanned across the project and
`/var/tmp/u2`; 171 carried `world = 1`, and **170 were repaired** through the tool and
re-verified (size still 384, byte reads 0). Every working seed is on Earth — `engine/saves/PLAYER`,
the container's `spice86-runs/seed-player`, and every scratch character under `/var/tmp/u2/`.

One file was deliberately left wrong: **`captures/spice86/cp5-g26-layout/player`**. A named
capture is the evidence record, and that capture genuinely recorded a character on planet 1.
Rewriting evidence to tidy up a tool bug is how a corpus stops being trustworthy.

The sweep also surfaced a second piece of fossil damage: **12,953 root-owned paths** under
`/var/tmp/u2`, in `spice86-runs/` and `novnc-saves/` — the residue of the container runs that
went through `sudo podman` before that was fixed the same day. They are `chown`ed back to the
user now and none remain, so the 27 saves inside them could be repaired. This does not recur:
the launchers are rootless, so new runs write as the user.
