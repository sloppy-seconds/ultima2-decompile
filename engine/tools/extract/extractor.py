"""extractor.py — turn the user's own copy of the game into engine headers.

Phase 4 rule: the engine ships zero game content. Every string the engine
displays is pulled at build time from a copy the user owns, into
engine/build/gen_content.h, which is gitignored. Nothing this script writes is
ever committed, and nothing it writes belongs in git history.

Two sources, in priority order:

  exe  --exe PATH (default: <repo>/original/ultimaii.exe when present).
         The real bytes, located inside the function range named by the
         manifest, so a community-patched build that shifted a string is still
         read correctly rather than silently mismatched.
  asm  the documented fallback (docs/phase4-plan.md CP1): the `db "...",0x00`
         lines of our own byte-proven asm/ tree. Used when no exe is present,
         e.g. a fresh clone or CI.

The manifest is (symbol, asm file, which string in that file). Offsets and
names are facts about the binary and ours to publish; the bytes at them are
not. `--check` regenerates and compares, so a stale header fails the build.

Usage:
  extractor.py [-o engine/build/gen_content.h] [--exe PATH] [--source auto|exe|asm]
  extractor.py --emit text      # SYMBOL<TAB>value per line, for test scripts
  extractor.py --check          # fail if the written header is not current
