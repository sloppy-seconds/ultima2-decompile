"""Red controls for the installer and config gates.

docs/install-design.md § 7 and AGENTS.md § 3: a gate has to be able to fail in the
place that enforces it, so each property below is broken one at a time in a
throwaway copy of the source, the real check is rebuilt against that copy, and the
control is only satisfied when the check goes red on exactly the assertions that
own the broken property.

Three ways a control lies, all of them detected here rather than waved through:
  * it does not compile, so nothing was tested
  * it goes red for an unrelated reason (a missing fixture directory)
  * it crashes: a SIGABRT with stdout still in the buffer looks identical to "no
    failures" unless the exit code is checked, and one of these controls really
    did abort for a reason unrelated to the property it claimed to test

Run by tests/run_cp4.sh; takes the CP4 work directory as argv[1].
