# A test whose control is a live dump is only as good as its ability to go red when the
# model drifts from that dump. Each mutation breaks one clause of asm/06ED's arithmetic in
# a COPY of speed.c (the repo file is never touched) and requires speed_check to fail.
# A mutation that leaves it green means the 20-slot table does not actually cover that clause.
