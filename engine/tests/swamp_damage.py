swamp_damage.py — CP5 gate E1: the two HP-costing tiles of asm/2423's effect ladder.

What is under test is the ENTRY asymmetry and the amount, not just the happy path. The
owner's three-way control (2026-11-02, docs/handoff-tile-effects.md § 3) is the shape of
this gate on purpose: a naive implementation that charges for STANDING on the swamp, or
for LEAVING it, passes only the middle case — and the middle case is exactly the one that
would fool a reviewer. So all three run, plus the controls that make the gate able to fail:

  enter   safe -> swamp: moved, HP 9997 -> 9992. The observed delta: nine live steps
          went 0370..0330, every one -5 (asm/2495 header).
  pass    PASS while standing on swamp: no move, HP unchanged. Owner control.
  exit    swamp -> safe: moved, HP unchanged. Owner control.
  grass   safe -> grass: moved, HP unchanged. Proves the cost is the tile, not the step.
  none    no key at all: HP unchanged. If HP drains by itself the gate cannot fail.
  death   HP 0004 onto a swamp: "IS DEAD!". The borrow out of [DS:51] falls through to
          `jmp L_000e62` (asm/0C62), so underflow is death, not a wrap.

The force-field rung of the same ladder (asm/24B1 -> asm/24B5) is gated here too, because
the step-site call is one code path and the sector gate covers both rungs:

  field   safe -> 0x5C: HP 9997 -> 8997 (sbb 0x10 on the HIGH BCD byte = -1000) and the
          "FIELD CAUSES 1000 DAMAGE!" string reaches the screen.
  ring    same with items_held[0] = 1: HP unchanged and "RING PROTECTS" prints — the
          [DS:D6] gate at asm/24B5.

Fresh seed dir per case: the engine rewrites the save in place (u2_gate.py's rule, and
handoff trap 4). HP is read from the raw dump pair DS:51/DS:52, high byte first, and
decoded as the four decimal digits it is.
