/*
 * save_q_check.c — CP4b: the Q save round trip.
 *
 * The owner's test, automated: create a character, move somewhere, save with
 * Q, quit, start again, press P — and land where you saved. The bytes say it
 * works because the save routine copies the live position into the entry
 * pair before writing (file 0x2520..0x2529: [0x5A]:=[0x00], [0x5B]:=[0x01]),
 * and the P path restores from that pair (file 0x0A26..0x0A2F). This test
 * proves the engine reproduces both halves, plus the location guard and the
 * CP11 extension point (the policy struct a "save anywhere" community patch
 * will flip).
