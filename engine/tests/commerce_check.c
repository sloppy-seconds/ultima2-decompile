/*
 * tests/commerce_check.c — the TRANSACT selector and the price model, as far as they are
 * proven.
 *
 * This file exists to reject two specific things, both of which were believed here and
 * both of which were wrong:
 *
 *   1. that the price formula cannot produce the numbers the game prints. It can. The two
 *      observations that said otherwise — a grocery quote of "0200" and an axe at 25 gp —
 *      were both misread, and both were re-measured on 2026-10-29 by stopping the CPU at
 *      the printer (asm/17B7) and at the charge (asm/2052) during real purchases
 *      (captures/spice86/g23-food-live, captures/spice86/g23-weapons). The grocery quote is
 *      0020 and the axe is 0020, and asm/20AB yields both.
 *   2. that the shop is chosen by which NPC you talked to. It is not: asm/1590 switches on
 *      the PLAYER's quadrant within the sector and on the site kind. Eight cells, and a
 *      wrong one of these is a shop that opens in the wrong half of town.
 *
 * Build and run from engine/, linking this file against every source under src/core,
 * src/game and src/debug — the same link line tests/run_cp6.sh uses.
