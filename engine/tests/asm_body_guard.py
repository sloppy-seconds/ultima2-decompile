"""asm_body_guard.py — the asm/ invariant CP0 actually needs.

Why this exists instead of the older per-file md5 check
------------------------------------------------------
The previous guard compared, file by file, the md5 of each changed file's
non-comment lines against HEAD, and treated ANY deletion as a failure. That was
right while the only permitted asm/ edit was a rename. It became wrong the moment
function *boundaries* were allowed to move: merging seven fragments into one
routine deletes six files and grows a seventh, and every one of those six
deletions is the guard reporting success as vandalism.

What is genuinely invariant is not which file a line lives in. It is that the
**assemblable content of the whole tree** is unchanged: no instruction line added,
removed, reordered or edited. Renaming, merging and splitting are all legitimate
maintenance acts on that content; editing it is not.

The check
---------
Build a canonical stream: for every `asm/*.asm`, sorted by the 4-hex start address
in its filename, concatenate the file's non-comment lines. Because the fragments
tile their address ranges contiguously and in order, sorting by start address makes
the stream independent of where the file boundaries sit. Merging and splitting
preserve it exactly. Any body edit, insertion, deletion or reorder breaks it.

Compared against the same stream built from `HEAD`.

Comment lines (leading '#') are excluded, so headers, evidence notes and
provenance may be rewritten freely -- which is what AGENTS.md § 3 requires in the
same commit that renames a file.

THE ONE EXCEPTION: a marked body correction
-------------------------------------------
Sometimes the body is provably WRONG, not merely mis-filed. asm/353A forced-kept one byte
of a four-byte instruction and asm/353D then decoded the leftover bytes as `push %ds` and
`dec %cx`: mnemonics that are not the code. `tools/forced_keep_audit.py` finds at least 63
such sites. Freezing those bodies forever protects a known falsehood, which is not what a
proof is for.

So a body may change IF AND ONLY IF the file carries a marker line:

    # body corrected: YYYY-MM-DD -- evidence: <what proved the old decode wrong>

and the marker must name its evidence. The marker grants permission to edit, it does not
grant permission to be wrong: **`tools/assemble_clean.sh` remains the authority.** A
corrected body that changes any byte fails there, so a marker cannot smuggle in a semantic
change -- if it still assembles to the same bytes it is by construction a valid decode of
them. The two gates are deliberately different: this one polices authorship, that one
polices truth.

Merging and splitting still need no marker, because they preserve the canonical stream.
Removing a file whose body lines vanish is still a failure even with a marker: the content
has to go somewhere.

Usage:
    python3 engine/tests/asm_body_guard.py [--base REF] [--list-marked]

  --base REF     compare against REF instead of HEAD. Locally HEAD is right, because the
                 guard's job there is to catch an edit before it is committed. In CI it is
                 WRONG: a clean checkout makes HEAD and the worktree the same thing, so the
                 comparison is vacuous and can only PASS. CI must pass the merge base. The
                 guard detects this and exits 2 rather than reporting a pass it did not earn.
  --list-marked  list every file carrying a correction marker, with its evidence.

Exit 0 = body content conserved, or changed only in marked files. Exit 1 = changed in an
unmarked file, or content removed. Exit 2 = misconfigured (CI without a real base).
