/*
 * combat_check.c — CP5 acceptance specification (tickets C1, C2, C6).
 *
 * This is BOTH a specification and a live test: src/game/combat.c implements
 * C1/C2/C6 and `run_cp5.sh` links this file against it on every `make test`
 * (4066 checks, 0 failures at the time of writing — the gate prints the real
 * number, do not trust a copy of it).
 *
 * It is additionally executed against two fixture models that ship beside it:
 * combat_model_faithful.c must pass and combat_model_boolean_wrong.c must fail.
 * That is what makes "the spec discriminates" a checked fact rather than a claim
 * in a comment — the original proof used throwaway models that no longer exist.
 *
 * Every expectation below is a byte in the original, cited by asm file address.
 * Grades per AGENTS.md § 5 are named in the section headers.
 *
 * The proposed API is declared here (the spec owns the contract) so this file
 * is syntax-checkable with only ctx.h/rng.h/state.h present. The accessors key
 * everything by the DS offset it mirrors, so the spec does not hardcode a
 * particular state.h field layout — the implementation chooses the fields, the
 * offsets are the contract.
 *
 *   counter_ds : 0x26B legs, 0x26C arms, 0x26D sleep   (asm/0E70,0EC2,0F48)
 *   item_ds    : DS:D6+i item array — 0xD6 RING, 0xD9 BOOTS, 0xDA CLOAK,
 *                0xE4 GREEN IDOL                        (findings § 12)
