"""dungeon_art_neutral.py — the dungeon must draw the same under every theme.

    python3 tests/dungeon_art_neutral.py [--selftest] [FILE ...]

Exits 0 when the dungeon renderer consults no theme atlas, 1 when it does.

Why this is a gate and not a comment. On 2026-11-06 the in-game notice
`THEME ART DOES NOT COVER DUNGEONS` was removed, because it fired on every dungeon
entry under the FM Towns theme to say the art was wrong in the one screen where the
theme makes no difference: the dungeon is a first-person wireframe drawn by
`dg_line` in CGA colour 3 (asm/4B76), and `dungeon.c` never touches a theme tile.
`default` stayed silent only because its manifest CLAIMS `scope = dungeon`.

That makes the removal safe for exactly one reason, and the reason is a fact about
the renderer that a future change could undo. If someone wires theme art into the
dungeon — a textured wall, a themed chest sprite — then a theme whose scope omits
dungeons is suddenly telling the truth, the notice has to come back, and this check
goes red so the decision is revisited rather than inherited.

--selftest proves the check can fail: it runs the same scan over a synthetic file
that does consult the atlas, and requires a finding. A gate that has never been
able to go red is worse than no gate.
