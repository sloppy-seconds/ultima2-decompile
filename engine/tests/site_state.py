site_state.py — CP5 gate: crossing a site edge must not write sector files.

What is under test is a negative, and it is the negative the engine used to get wrong.
site_enter() and site_leave() used to flush the outgoing sector to mapxNN and monxNN, on a
comment citing asm/22FD as "stores the sector being left". asm/22FD is `mov 0x6d,%al ;
or %al,%al ; je` — a boots gate with no I/O in it. The real sector store is asm/2305, which is
reached on the save path (Q), and that path still writes and still should.

The measurement that settled it is 2026-10-29, owner-driven over noVNC in sector 31: after
several town entries and exits, mapx31, monx31, mapx30 and monx30 in the run dir were
byte-identical to the pristine copies. Only `player` had changed. Docs: docs/save-format.md
§ 10, docs/map-format.md § 10, docs/monster-spawn.md § 16, and the OPEN DEFECT in
docs/phase4-state.md.

Two cases, and they are the two halves of a gate that can fail in both directions:

* **original mode (default)** — dirty a sector, cross the edge, and the sector files on disk
  must be untouched. This is the case that was red before the fix: BOARD paves its tile, which
  marks the map dirty, and the transition wrote it out.
* **--enhanced --keep-site-state** — the same run must write the paved tile to the file. This
  is the owner's option (2026-10-29) for keeping town state, and it is opt-in only: the
  original has no such knob, so `original` mode must never take this path.

Everything here is engine-authored filler, so it runs in CI without the player's game files.
