"""content_immutable.py — the gate docs/save-scoped-worlds.md § 5 calls the one that matters most.

The property: **once the content tree exists, playing the game never modifies a file
inside it.** Every sector write belongs to a save and lands in `saves/<slot>/`. This is
the exact thing that went wrong on the owner's install — a played-in `mapx20` with two
creature stamps baked into the release map, and `map_base` loading its pristine terrain
from that same file, so the damage was sticky.

Why a gate and not an eyeball: the write-back is faithful to `asm/2305`, so what changed is
*where* it lands, and "where" is invisible from how the game behaves on screen. A hash of
the content tree before and after a real session is the only thing that says it.

Three ways this could pass vacuously, each handled rather than assumed:

  * the session writes nothing, so nothing could have drifted. The gate therefore asserts
    the positive half too: the slot must hold an overlay, and the overlay must be the file
    that received the change. No overlay means the comparison above proved nothing. The
    scenario is BOARD then Q, because boarding is a terrain edit (u2_world_terrain_put)
    and the save is what stores a dirty sector — the same route tests/vehicle_board.py
    uses, rather than a second invention of it.
  * the harness points at the wrong directory and compares an empty tree. It asserts the
    tree it hashed is non-empty before it starts.
  * the comparison cannot fail. `--control` dirties one byte of a content file between the
    two hashes and requires the diff to name it. A control that cannot go red is the
    failure mode AGENTS.md § 3 exists to stop, so it runs on every invocation, not only on
    demand.

And the gate itself was demonstrated red where it enforces, not only locally: building
the engine against a `u2_world_store` that writes back into the layer the sector was
read from — the rule this change replaced — makes it report
`playing a session changed nothing under the content directory: mapx00: ... -> ...`
and `the run did write a sector, and it landed in the save slot`. A passing hash
comparison with no overlay behind it is the vacuous shape, and it is a failure here.

Everything it touches is engine-authored filler from cp5_fight_seed.py, in a throwaway
directory, so this runs in CI with no game media present.
