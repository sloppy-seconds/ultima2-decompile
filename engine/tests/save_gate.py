save_gate.py — CP5 gate for the three Q guards, and the enhanced mode that drops them.

The chain is cmd_Q at file 0x3FC7, read off the bytes (objdump of original/ultimaii.exe,
2026-10-29), in this order and no other:

    3FDD  mov al,[DS:4A] ; or al,al ; je 3FFA   -> inside a site: "ONLY OUTDOORS!"
    3FFA  mov al,[DS:6D] ; or al,al ; je 4017   -> DS:6D set:    "ONLY ON EARTH!"
    4017  mov al,[DS:13] ; cmp $0x78 ; jae 4033 -> not on foot:  "ONLY ON FOOT!"
    4033  "ONE MOMENT PLEASE!" ; call asm/22FD  -> the save runs

Two of these the engine had stubbed away on assumptions that have since died: the comment said
DS:6D is a planet counter that cannot be non-zero until CP7, and DS:13 is a vehicle stamp that
cannot be set until CP6. Vehicles landed the same week this gate was written, and DS:6D is a
live byte that refuses the save for any character not on Earth — which is what it has always
meant (world 0 = Earth, 1..9 = the planets, 0x0A = deep space; see G44 and
`asm/3DFA_offer_only_outdoors_earth.asm`). The CP7 guess was right; the boots name on it was
ours, written by `tools/u2_edit.py`. See captures/spice86/save-wilderness and
docs/save-format.md § 10.

Enhanced mode is the owner's call of 2026-10-29: save anywhere. It is a policy, not an edit to
the loop — u2_overworld_save() consults u2_save_policy and nothing else, which is the reason
the struct exists.

Every case asserts the refusal text AND that no save happened, or that the save did. A gate
that only checks the message would pass on an engine that printed the words and saved anyway.
