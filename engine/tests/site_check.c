/*
 * tests/site_check.c — the world-map gate table: which tile enters which site.
 *
 * asm/3389_cmd_E prints ENTER and asm/33A6..33FF dispatches on [DS:14] >> 1, and
 * DS:14 is map_byte >> 1 (CP5 ticket C7), so the gate is tile >> 2. The mapping
 * below is that shift, and the digit column is NOT the shift: 7 is a tower, which
 * is sector digit 4, and 8 is a castle, which is digit 3. Anyone who "simplifies"
 * that will produce towns that load tower files, quietly.
 *
 * The second half is the check that matters, and it is the one that can only be
 * made against the player's own content: every gate cell in every world sector
 * must name a sector file that exists. On the 2026-10-27 content set that is 21
 * gate cells and 21 existing files, and the dungeon gate in mapx30 is the cell the
 * live capture walked into when DS:49/4A went from 3,0 to 3,5.
 *
 * argv[1] is the content directory; without it the data half SKIPs (a missing
 * --data-dir is not a test failure, same rule as world_check.c).
 *
 * Build and run by tests/run_cp5.sh.
