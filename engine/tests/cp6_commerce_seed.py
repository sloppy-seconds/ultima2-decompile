"""Emit a synthetic content directory for the CP6 commerce gate.

Engine-authored filler, same rule cp5_fight_seed.py follows: a gate that needs a shop
on a map must not depend on the player's own game files, and CI has no copy of them.
The bytes are shaped like the real ones because the engine reads them the same way.

What the geometry has to reproduce is the ray, not a town. asm/4050 steps one cell in the
aimed direction, requires that cell to be a shop sign (high-bit tile) or 0x7C, steps a
second cell and requires 0x68. So each case is three cells in a line: player, sign, marker.

The quadrant decides the shop (asm/1590), so the marker's position is not incidental —
putting the same geometry in the north-west half of a town yields the weapons shoppe and
nothing else about the cells changes.
