tests/site_viewport_gate.py — a site sector must not draw the world map's wrap.

Why this exists as its own gate rather than as another line in view_check.c:
view_check pins what u2_view_fill does with a mode byte it is handed, and the
defect this guards was one level up. engine/src/game/overworld.c derived the mode
only on site entry, so a save loaded inside a settlement came back in world-map
mode and rendered as a torus. In Port Boniface that pulled the town's north sign
band onto the bottom of the screen, and the owner reported it as water
surrounding the south exit. The original fills past the edge of a site with the
sector's own ground byte; see core/view.h's U2_VIEW_SITE_OFFGRID and
captures/spice86/s31-south-edge/.

The assertion is deliberately the one the capture can actually support. Rows 7, 8
and 9 of a frame taken at (31,62) in sector 31 are, in the original, three copies
of one tile: black with a sparse cyan dither, 220 cyan pixels per row, and no
grey at all. The wrapped content is the town's sign row, which is full of white
glyph pixels. So "the three rows agree with each other and carry no grey" is
exactly the property that distinguishes the two behaviours, and it is the property
that would silently come back if anyone reinstated an unconditional `& 63`.
