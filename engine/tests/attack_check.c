/*
 * tests/attack_check.c — CP5 W3: the player's attack, against the real combat.c.
 *
 * This is NOT part of combat_check.c on purpose. That file is a specification that
 * runs against two fixture models, and it exists to pin a contract before the
 * code lands. The attack is implemented, so it gets tested directly; adding it to
 * the spec would mean writing two more fixture models of a thing that already
 * exists, which is how you end up with three copies of a rule drifting apart.
 *
 * Every expectation cites the byte it came from. The three that are easy to get
 * wrong, and are therefore pinned hardest here:
 *   - the hit operand is the AGILITY BYTE, not strength (asm/2BDA, asm/2E3D 0x307E);
 *   - damage is computed on packed-decimal bytes, so strength 40 is 64 (0x309F);
 *   - the gold/exp field names in state.h are inverted relative to significance.
 *
 * Build and run by tests/run_cp5.sh.
