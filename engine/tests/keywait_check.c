/*
 * keywait_check.c — the seam_key_wait contract, driven by a fake input backend.
 *
 * Why a fake backend and not a scripted run: the defect only appears on the third
 * answer a backend can give. The script backend reports a spent run as 0, the
 * terminal reports EOF as 0, and only SDL answers -1 — for a window close or a
 * SIGINT. So no headless scripted capture could ever have shown it, and the report
 * came from a human pressing Ctrl-C: "in the character creation screen, closing
 * the window or Ctrl-C is taken as a down button".
 *
 * The mechanism the checks below pin down: seam_key_poll has always collapsed its
 * backend's three states to 1/0, and seam_key_wait did not. Callers ask `if (!got)`
 * or `if (got == 0)`, so a -1 was read as "a key arrived" and the caller then read
 * out->ch, which the backend never wrote. Because u2_key sits at the same stack
 * offset on every iteration, that byte still held the LAST key pressed — Down, on
 * the creation form.
