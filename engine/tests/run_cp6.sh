# tests/run_cp6.sh — CP6 commerce SPEC: the TRANSACT ray, the vendor selector, the price.
#
# Three things happen here, in the order run_cp5.sh established:
#
#   1. tests/commerce_check.c is compiled and run. It is the pure half: the price walk,
#      the selector table, and the BCD charge. It needs no content and runs in CI.
#   2. The behavioural half drives ./u2 against a synthetic sector built by
#      tests/cp6_commerce_seed.py — engine-authored filler, never the player's own files —
#      and asserts the shop text, the gold, and the owned-count slot for each purchase.
#   3. The gaps are asserted too. The pub, the cleric shrine, the wizard shoppe, the clue
#      seller and the talking branch are NOT implemented, and a gate that only checks what
#      works cannot tell an unimplemented branch from a broken one. So the pub case asserts
#      silence, and the two broken-ray cases assert the refusal.
#
# The behavioural half SKIPs when the content strings are empty, which is what they are
# without a copy of the game to extract from (docs/phase4-plan.md: the engine ships zero
# content). A skip that can hide a failure is not a skip — so the skip names the symbols it
# needed, and commerce_check still runs.
