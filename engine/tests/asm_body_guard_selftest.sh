# asm_body_guard_selftest.sh — prove the body guard can still go red.
#
# The guard was just given an exception path (a `# body corrected:` marker permits a body
# change). AGENTS.md: "A gate that cannot go red is worse than a tool that lies... demonstrate
# a gate failing before you trust it passing." An exception path is exactly where a gate
# silently dies, so all four controls run here:
#
#   1  body changed, NO marker            -> guard MUST fail   (the original guarantee)
#   2  body changed, WITH marker          -> guard MUST pass   (the new permission works)
#   3  marker + a change that alters BYTES-> assemble_clean/check_func MUST fail even though
#      the guard passes                   (the exception cannot smuggle a semantic change)
#   4  body MOVED between files, stream preserved -> guard MUST pass with no marker
#                                          (merges stay legal -- today's three merges)
