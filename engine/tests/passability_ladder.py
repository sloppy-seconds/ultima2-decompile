passability_ladder.py — CP5 gate for the on-foot passability ladder.

Why this is a gate and not a unit test: the thing under test is a verdict the engine reaches by
walking, and the failure mode it guards against is a *shape* error — someone replacing the ladder
with a per-tile table again, which is what caused every passability regression this project has had
(docs/passability-findings.md F14). A unit test on the C function would pass for a table that
happened to agree on the rows someone thought of. This drives the real engine and checks whether the
player actually moved.

Method, one fresh seed per tile: put the candidate byte in the cell directly east of the entry,
press RIGHT once, and read the position back out of the turn dump. Moved means accepted. A fresh
save dir every time is not tidiness — the engine rewrites the save in place, and a reused dir was
already responsible for one wrong count in this session.

The expected column is the ladder's verdict, cross-checked against the seven live measurements in
F14's agreement table. Water and mountain are the two named rejections; the eight named
acceptances include the four vehicle tiles, which the old table blocked and which is the whole
reason this was rewritten.

# ---- the travel-mode arms (W2) ---------------------------------------------------
#
# The foot ladder above is only one of five arms. asm/253B branches on [DS:13] first, and
# the four vehicle arms disagree with the summary they were first given in two ways that
# cost this project a wrong table each time it was written from a header instead of a body:
#
#   * horse and plane are NOT "the same ladder as foot". asm/2626 calls the foot tail (so
#     the ladder runs) and then rejects mode 0x02 (map 0x04, shallow water) and 0x60 of its
#     own accord. The plane adds mode 0x06 (map 0x0C, forest) at asm/2604.
#   * the rocket accepts NOTHING. asm/2542 jumps to the reject return; the unconditional
#     accept that asm/25F8 is is the foot ladder's own fall-through, three instructions
#     ahead of the reject the rocket arm lands on.
#   * the ship is water only: asm/2619 accepts [DS:29] == 0x00 and its second compare,
#     0x80, is unreachable because the value is a map byte shifted right once.
#
# Each case boards the vehicle on its own tile at the entry cell, then probes the candidate
# one step east, and reads the position back. Fresh seed per case, same rule as above.
