# tests/run_cp7.sh — CP7 SPEC: the interior sector. Enter it, light it, walk it,
# fight it, loot it, go deeper.
#
# Why this is a behavioural gate and not a unit one: everything CP7 touches is a
# coordinate. The grid is 16 pages of 16x16 indexed by a floor byte, the facing is
# a signed pair, the light is a step counter, and the renderer walks three columns
# out to seven depths. A unit test can check that a table was transcribed; only a
# run can show that a player who pressed four keys is standing where the map says
# they should be.
#
# The fixture is tests/cp7_dungeon_seed.py, which writes a dungeon built to answer
# the assertions rather than a maze copied from the shipped mapx25 — see that
# file's header for why.
#
# SKIP rule, same as CP6: the dungeon literals are `run` locators into asm regions
# Phase 3 rendered as db bytes, so with no copy of the game to extract from they
# come out empty and asserting on them would assert on nothing. The skip names the
# symbols it needed.
