/*
 * tests/death_check.c — CP5 W8: the death tail, against the real overworld.c.
 *
 * asm/0C62..0C99 as one span: zero DS:51..DS:59, repaint the status band, three
 * newlines, the name from DS:36, then " IS DEAD!" and a newline. The reference
 * frame is `captures/spice86/cp5-weak-fight/death1.png`, and it is the reason
 * two of the assertions below are where they are:
 *
 *   - The announcement is on row 22, NOT the bottom row. The trailing 0x8d in
 *     asm/0C8C's db is a newline, so the line scrolls one row up the moment it
 *     finishes, and row 23 is left blank. Intuition says "the last line is the
 *     bottom line"; the pixels say otherwise, and the pixels win.
 *   - There is no `CMD: ` prompt after it. The prompt travels with a command's
 *     compound echo, and the death tail has no command.
 *   - All four status fields read 0000, which is the observation that makes this
 *     file repaint the whole band where asm/0C62 calls only the H.P. line.
 *
 * Build and run by tests/run_cp5.sh.
