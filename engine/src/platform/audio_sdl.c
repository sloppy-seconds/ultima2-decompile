/*
 * audio_sdl.c — sampled PC-speaker output.
 *
 * seam: speaker_freq (asm/5CD2_speaker_freq.asm). The original latches PIT
 * channel 2 with a 16-bit divisor; the engine hands the same divisor here, so
 * the only translation needed is divisor -> frequency, using the 8253's
 * 1.193182 MHz time base. The speaker was a square wave, so that is what is
 * generated — not a sine, and not a "beep" approximation.
 *
 * SDL's audio stream API is used rather than a callback: the tone is finite and
 * known in advance, so queueing pre-generated samples avoids a shared-state
 * callback and the locking it would need. SDL3 removed SDL_QueueAudio along with
 * the whole legacy SDL_OpenAudio path, so this now opens a device-backed stream
 * and pushes into it; the reasoning for avoiding a callback is unchanged.
