/*
 * roots.h — the content roots, in precedence order. One list, one owner.
 *
 * docs/install-design.md § 3 rules the layout: `--install` writes explicit layers
 * (`data/updated` over `data/original`) and the drop-in case has the same two
 * layers at the game root (`updated` over `.`). The mechanism that makes both work
 * is an ordered root list rather than a branch on "which layout is this", and the
 * moment two files each carry their own copy of that list, they will disagree —
 * which is the failure mode this project keeps hitting and keeps naming.
 *
 * So world.c, tiles.c and pic.c all ask here. world.c needs the roots paired with
 * per-kind filename prefixes and so uses the table directly; the rest want the
 * simpler question, "where is this file", which is u2_root_find().
