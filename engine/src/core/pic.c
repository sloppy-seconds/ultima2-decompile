 * See pic.h for the format evidence and the copyright posture. The short version: the files
 * are literal images of CGA mode-4 video memory, and asm/5351 points DS at 0xB800 (that
 * framebuffer segment) in what is clearly the picture load, so there is no codec here and no
 * header to skip. Which instruction moves the bytes is not established; see pic.h. The engine's
 * u2_frame already stores one CGA index per pixel, so this is a planar-to-linear unpack of
 * 16,000 bytes into 64,000.
