/*
 * Engine text font — 8x8 bitmap glyphs blitted into the framebuffer.
 *
 * Owner decision 2026-10-20 (docs/phase4-kickoff-cp4b.md): the text
 * *mechanism* is ours to choose — readable text in the right place with the
 * right values, not a reproduction of the original's BIOS plumbing. The data
 * is dhepper/font8x8 (Public Domain), vendored in font8x8_basic.h; see
 * THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES. Px437 was assessed and is a visual reference only.
 *
 * What stays the game's own: A-Z for in-world site-name banners uses the
 * extracted tile letters (art 32-57, core/tiles.h), not this font. This
 * module is for the status band, menu and creation text only.
 *
 * Geometry: the grid is 40x25 cells of 8x8 px, which is exactly the 320x200
 * mode-4 screen (platform.h), so a cell (row, col) maps to pixel origin
 * (col*8, row*8) with no scaling and no fractional cells.
 *
 * Bit order (font8x8 convention): one byte per pixel row, LSB = leftmost
 * pixel, row 0 at the top.
