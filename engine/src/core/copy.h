 * copy.h — the file operations the installer and the theme builder share.
 *
 * These live here rather than inside install.c because there is now a second
 * builder (core/themes.c) that must copy with the same guarantee, and a copy
 * routine that exists twice is a copy routine whose two halves disagree about what
 * "succeeded" means. The guarantee is the point: a file is not copied until it has
 * been hashed back from disk and compared, so a short write, a partial write or a
 * silently truncated file is a failure return rather than a story told afterwards.
