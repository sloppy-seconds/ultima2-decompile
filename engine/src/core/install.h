/*
 * install.h — building a game directory out of a pile of media.
 * docs/install-design.md is the design; this is its § 2, § 3, § 6 and § 8.
 *
 * This is a tool mode, not a game mode: it runs before video init, needs no
 * renderer, and lives in core/ rather than platform/ so that the terminal build
 * the whole test suite drives can execute it. That is not a preference — a
 * shipped installer nobody can run in CI is an installer nobody can prove.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything below, and each exists because the project has
 * been burned by its absence:
 *
 *   1. NEVER write into a source. The player's download comes out untouched, and
 *      `--check` can prove it because the manifest records sources by path and
 *      hash without ever opening them for writing.
 *   2. Copy verbatim or do not copy. No renames, no case-fixing, no running the
 *      fan patch's RENGAL.BAT. A transformation is a claim, and claims need
 *      evidence; the engine's own layer precedence (core/world.c) is the evidence
 *      that verbatim is enough.
 *   3. Verify by re-derivation, not by "the copy returned 0". Every file written
 *      is hashed back from disk against the hash of its source, and the manifest
 *      is what a later `--check` re-derives against.
