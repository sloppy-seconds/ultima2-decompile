 * Enhanced-mode screen layout.
 *
 * The shape comes from the FM Towns version as photographed in
 * references/fmtowns-screens, and it is a reimplementation of a presentation, not
 * a byte-matching target: the FM Towns binary has never been disassembled here, so
 * every number below is measured from photographs of a CRT and carries that grade.
 * docs/enhanced-layout-plan.md § 1 has the measurements and § 9 the owner rulings.
 *
 * The one number that is NOT from the reference is the map size. The reference map
 * is 11 x 12 because FM Towns draws its panel text at about 16 px, and a readable
 * panel at that size costs 276 px of the 640. Our font is 8x8 and the owner ruled
 * the panel at 8 px, which buys back the columns: 14 x 14 = 196 cells, against the
 * DOS window's 200. That is the whole reason the enhanced map is square-ish and the
 * reference is not.

 *
 * 1024x512 rather than a full 4:3: the width is what lets a 14-column map and a
 * readable 16px panel coexist, and the height is only what the map plus the bar
 * need, so there is no dead band under the map. Fits a 1024x768 display with room
 * to spare, which is the smallest display the owner was willing to assume. */

 * u2_tiles_ega_present(), so every theme fills the same map cell instead of a v1
 * theme occupying a quarter of the space. The cost is width: 768 rather than the

/* ---- the panel, as ruled 2026-11-05 -------------------------------------
 *
 * The first shape stacked three full-width boxes, and the owner's verdict was that
 * the top two were far too wide for what they hold. They now sit side by side, the
 * vitals as a single column of H E G F rather than a 2x2 grid, with the command log
 * pushed to the bottom and a deliberate empty band between them.
 *
 * That band is not unfinished work. The owner asked for the room specifically to
 * spend on ideas later, so nothing here should feel obliged to fill it.
 *
 * The panel is 36 text cells wide (576 px / 16) and divides as 1 + 14 + 1 + 19 + 1:
 * a one-cell gutter on each side, then the two boxes. Every width below is a whole
 * number of cells because the font API snaps to that grid: a box edge landing
 * between cells is how borders went missing once already. The outer gutters are not
 * decoration — with the boxes flush to the frame edge their right border was the
 * last pixel column and read as an open box.
