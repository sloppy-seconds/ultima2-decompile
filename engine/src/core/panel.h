/*
 * Enhanced-mode side panel: the three boxes to the right of the map.
 *
 * The arrangement is the FM Towns version's, as measured in
 * docs/enhanced-layout-plan.md § 1-2. The CONTENT is ours: the owner ruled that
 * enhanced mode is a reimplementation of a presentation rather than a byte
 * matching target, so the labels here are ours and the stat order is ours, not the
 * reference's (which runs STR AGI INT WIS CHA STA and abbreviates equipment as
 * WEA:/ARM:). Every invented string is marked as invented at its site.
 *
 * Colours are never hardcoded palette indices. A v2 theme brings its own palette
 * and index 3 can be black there — the exact trap that made status text invisible
 * in the FM Towns theme — so the backdrop, border and bar are chosen by scanning
 * the palette that is actually in use.
