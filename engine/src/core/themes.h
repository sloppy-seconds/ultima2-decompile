/*
 * themes.h — building a themes/ tree out of the player's own EGA art. This is the
 * v1 reshape, and it is the only theme builder: the Python tool that used to do it
 * was deleted rather than kept beside this one, because two builders of the same
 * format is two definitions of it, and the format is a contract with the engine
 * (docs/theme-format.md) that only gets one owner.
 *
 * The rules it implements, each learned the expensive way and recorded in
 * docs/handoff-themes-builder.md:
 *
 *   * A theme is a directory whose CONTENTS include a tile atlas. Not one named
 *     `EGATHEME.*` — keying discovery on the vendor's directory name produced a
 *     tree with no themes in it, and the engine then refused every theme by name
 *     while the builder reported success.
 *   * Copy WHOLE theme directories. A theme is EGATILES plus an optional EGACOLOR
 *     plus optional PIC*.EGA, and the optionality is per-theme; selective copying
 *     silently drops a theme's own extras and you get a half-recoloured game.
 *   * Emit every file byte-identical. Nothing here decodes or re-encodes art.
 *   * A build is not done until it has been verified against what it wrote.
 *
 * What is NOT here: the FM Towns v2 derivation. That needs the disc, an ISO reader
 * and the crosswalk, and it was deferred by ruling 4 of docs/install-design.md § 11
 * rather than abandoned; u2_themes_check still verifies a themes/fmtowns tree that
 * something else produced, and docs/fmtowns-graphics.md plus
 * disasm/fmtowns-crosswalk.tsv remain the record of how it is derived.
