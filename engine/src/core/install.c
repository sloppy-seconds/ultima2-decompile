 *
 * docs/save-scoped-worlds.md § 4. An existing install has `saves/PLAYER` as a
 * FILE, and the new layout needs `saves/PLAYER/` as a directory, so the two
 * cannot coexist: this is the one place that can move a player's record, and the
 * one place allowed to, because it is the only place that can say what the file
 * is. The engine never moves a save; it refuses.
 *
 * Four rules, and the last one outranks the others:
 *
 *   - move, never copy, and never overwrite. A rename that would land on an
 *     existing file is refused rather than resolved.
 *   - print every move, and print the plan under --dry-run, because the pre-flight
 *     is the only chance to catch a migration that would move the wrong thing.
 *   - idempotent: a second run finds nothing to do.
 *   - a real save is never deleted. Anything this code cannot prove is the release
 *     blank becomes its own slot, even when that leaves it unselectable. Losing a
 *     game to a cleanup is the failure the whole document exists to prevent.
 *
 * A crash between the two renames of step 1 leaves the record under a temporary
 * name in the same directory; the next run puts it back and does the move
 * properly, so an interrupted migration is recoverable rather than half-gone.
