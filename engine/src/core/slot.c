 *
 * An older build kept the record as a FILE at `<save_dir>/PLAYER`, which is
 * exactly where the slot directory has to go, so until it moves nothing at all can
 * be saved — and a player who upgraded the binary without running --install would
 * find a game that cannot write, in the drop-in layout where there is no installer
 * to run. So this adopts it: two renames inside one directory, never an overwrite,
 * and it never touches the content tree.
 *
 * That last clause is why the repair of played-in CONTENT files stays in the
 * installer and does not come here: telling a release map from a stamped one needs
 * _INSTALL.tsv, and the engine has no such record. Moving a record needs nothing
 * but the fact that a directory cannot take a file's name while the file holds it.
 *
 * If the intermediate name already exists, a previous move was interrupted in a way
 * this code cannot reason about, so it refuses and leaves everything alone rather
 * than guessing. The installer's migration is the tool for that tree.
