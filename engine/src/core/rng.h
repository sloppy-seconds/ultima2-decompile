/*
 * Random byte — the shift-register PRNG.
 *
 * spec: asm/5217_rand_byte.asm + asm/522B_sub_522b.asm + asm/5236_sub_5236.asm.
 * Phase 3 split this routine across three "function" boundaries; read together
 * (runtime 0x5217..0x523D) it is:
 *
 *   push ax; push bx
 *   stc
 *   al  = DS:0x240
 *   al += DS:0x243 + 1        (adc, carry in from stc)
 *   al += DS:0x244 + carry    (adc)
 *   DS:0x23F = al             the new value
 *   bx = 4
 * 1: al = DS:0x23F(bx)        shift the window one byte left ...
 *    DS:0x240(bx) = al        ... five times (jns runs bx = 4..0)
 *    dec bx ; jns 1b
 *   pop bx ; pop ax
 *   al = DS:0x23F
 *   or al, al                 callers branch on the zero flag
 *   ret
 *
 * So the state is the six bytes DS:0x23F..0x244 and it is rewritten on every
 * call: a feedback shift register, not a clock sampler. docs/phase4-plan.md §1
 * described those bytes as tick counters; the decode says otherwise, and
 * nothing else in the binary writes them (only asm/0100_sub_0100.asm seeds
 * them). Consequences that matter for this project:
 *
 *   - rolls are a pure function of (seed, number of rolls so far), so monster
 *     spawns, encounters and combat rolls replay exactly for the same inputs;
 *   - the original's seed is the BIOS keyboard-flag byte at 0x40:6C, which is
 *     normally zero at startup, so the shipped game is itself effectively
 *     deterministic per boot;
 *   - no wall-clock source is needed for reproducibility, and none is used.
 *
 * The engine keeps the state in the DS mirror (u2_state.rng_state) so a dump
 * shows exactly what the original's memory would have shown.

 * This exists because asm/0100's seeding cannot express a mid-game state: it writes six copies of one
 * byte and then increments two of them, so the reachable startup states are 256 out of 2^48. A
 * recording taken from the original at turn N holds six arbitrary bytes, and resuming there needs a
 * raw load.
 *
 * That is what makes cross-game replay possible at all. The original's idle loop advances the register
 * on the BIOS timer, so the register at any turn is a function of emulated time as well as commands;
 * replaying a seed and a key script from boot only reproduces a session if the pacing matches tick for
 * tick. Resuming from the recorded register sidesteps the question entirely — each turn starts from the
 * state the original actually had. See docs/plan-cross-game-replay.md § 6b/§ 6c.
 *
 * ctx->rng_rolls is a diagnostic counter, not part of the original's state, and is reset: after a load
 * the engine has not rolled anything yet.
