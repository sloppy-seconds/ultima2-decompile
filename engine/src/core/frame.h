/*
 * Framebuffer — the pixel side of the engine, and the seam that should have
 * existed from the start.
 *
 * Why this is a core module and not a renderer detail: the original runs the
 * whole game in video mode 4 (asm/4A3E: INT 10h AH=00h AL=04h, 320x200), and
 * it draws *everything* there, including its text — the site-name banners use
 * the custom A-Z tiles from the tile table, not the CGA ROM font. A character
 * grid is therefore a simplification of the original, not a faithful model of
 * it, and any display backend that wants to be honest needs pixels.
 *
 * So pixel generation lives here, in dependency-free C11, and a backend only
 * moves bytes to a screen: SDL2 uploads them as a texture, kitty or sixel
 * encodes them, PPM writes them to a file, the null backend counts them. That
 * split is what keeps the game portable instead of terminal-specific.
 *
 * Geometry, all proven in docs/phase4-implementation.md § CP4:
 *   - screen 320x200, one CGA row = 80 bytes at 2bpp
 *   - the map window is 20x10 tiles at rows 0..19, full width (asm/5AE1 fill
 *     loop bounds, asm/4ABB flush loop bounds, and the screenshots, three
 *     independent confirmations)
 *   - a tile is 16x16 at 2bpp, leftmost pixel in the top two bits
 *   - the original stages tile IDs then flushes to video; this mirrors that by
 *     compositing into a frame the caller then presents

 *             The live capture has the origin pair at 16,16, so the view is
 *             inset by one tile-width on the left and top.
 *   asm/67B3  line. A two-branch integer Bresenham: the deltas are taken as
 *             absolute values with the step sign kept separately in [DS:47D]/
 *             [DS:47E], and the branch is chosen by `cmp |dx|,|dy|` — one loop
 *             steps x as the major axis, the other y. The loop count is the
 *             major delta and each iteration plots one pixel.
 *
 *             This is a conventional Bresenham, not a transcription. The
 *             original's accumulator is a single byte that wraps, and a
 *             byte-wrapped accumulator drifts on shallow slopes (a 4x1 line
 *             steps y twice). Reproducing the drift would be reproducing a
 *             rounding bug nobody can distinguish from intent, so the engine
 *             keeps the structure and uses the standard error term. Grade:
 *             inferred, and it is a rendering choice, not a behavioural one.
 *
 * Out-of-bounds pixels are dropped, not wrapped: the original writes straight
 * into video and a coordinate off the edge would corrupt the frame buffer of
 * whatever else is resident, which is a bug worth not reproducing.
