 * CP5 — combat specials (paralysis, sleep) and thief theft.
 *
 * Tickets C1, C2, C6 of docs/phase4-state.md § CP5. The acceptance spec is
 * tests/combat_check.c; this file implements the bytes, not the spec's fixture.
 * That distinction matters for theft: the faithful control model picks uniformly
 * among non-empty slots, which satisfies the assertions but is NOT what the
 * original does. The original rolls a probability and then a slot index, and a
 * miss on either is silent. Both are implemented here.
 *
 * Storage lives in u2_state, keyed by the DS offset the spec names:
 *   counters  DS:26B/26C/26D  -> state.paral_legs / paral_arms / paral_sleep
 *   items     DS:D6..DS:E5    -> state.items_held[0..15]

 *             wound loop uses), i.e. the report of the gun
 *   asm/35F0  call asm/23E6, the creature probe: cursor = player + delta, ONE cell
 *   asm/35F3  the found slot goes to [DS:20]; zero jumps to asm/2E09, which prints "--MISS"
 *   asm/3603  roll rand_byte
 *   asm/3606  `or $0x20,%al` and store to [DS:1F] — bit 5 forced onto a full-range random byte,
 *             so the reachable damage is every byte with bit 5 set: 32..63, 96..127, 160..191,
 *             224..255. Floor 32, ceiling 255. asm/2C19's header used to call this "32..63", and
 *             that is wrong — `or` sets a bit, it does not mask. Corrected here and there on
 *             2026-10-29 by attack_check, which sweeps all 256 seeds and shows values over 63.
 *   asm/3611  fall into asm/2C19, the second HP-decrement site, which subtracts [DS:1F]
 *
 * Two things this closes and one it does not. It closes the open question in
 * asm/2C19_monster_hp_subtract's header ("what selects the slot and why that magnitude is not
 * established") — the slot is the one-cell creature probe and the magnitude is a forced-low
 * random byte. It also means asm/3611 is not the town-NPC damage path it was once promoted to.
 *
 * What it does NOT close is the RANGE, and the owner's recollection and the bytes disagreed here
 * until a live run settled it. The recollection was a 3-space cannon, which is what makes shelling
 * a shore from 2-3 tiles out safe. The live game says ONE CELL: targets planted at 1, 2 and 3
 * cells east and fired at with the same keypress hit twice at distance 1 and missed at 2 and 3
 * (captures/spice86/cannon-range-live, 2026-10-29 — the frigate state built by poking [DS:13],
 * the target by planting mon_type/x/y with [DS:26A] frozen so it could not wander). The static
 * reason agreed all along: asm/23E6 seeds its cursor at player + delta and compares every
 * creature against that single cell, and its own header carries a standing warning that it is
 * "not a ray with a reach"; cmd_T builds a two-cell ray by stepping the cursor twice in its own
 * body and cmd_F has no such stepping. Now both witnesses agree, and the frame is the one that
 * cannot be argued with.
 *
 * The same capture confirmed two things this file had only inferred. A successful cannon prints
 * NOTHING — the frame shows `FIRE DIRECT-EAST` with no `--MISS` and no damage line — and the HP
 * subtract is plain binary on a BCD-looking field (0x99 - 0x3E = 0x5B, and asm/2C19 has no das),
 * which is what `apply_damage_to_slot` already does.
 *
 * The tone is deliberately not emitted. seam_tone wants a PIT divisor and a duration, and
 * asm/5DA9's header says its frequency arithmetic "is inferred and has not been confirmed
 * against a tone heard in a capture". A guessed tone is worse than none, and the text this
