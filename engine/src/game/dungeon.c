 *     b0 = x, and x == 0 ends the list

 * the four pixels inside one video byte get lit. So one record paints a run of one to
 * four pixels, and a creature is a list of those runs.
 *
 * The base pointer is where the design shows. asm/68ED has two arms:

 *   di >= 2 (further):  base = [DS:474] + cs:[0x697E+di] -> block 0's tail, no type term
 * That second arm looks like a dropped operand and is not one. Blocks 1..7 each hold one
 * full-detail creature; block 0's tail holds the ladder the far arm indexes — 24 records
 * at 0x080, 6 at 0x0C0, 4 at 0x0E0, 2 at 0x0F0, 1 at 0x0F8, which plot as a 6x4 blob, then
 * 2x3, 2x2, 1x2, 1x1. A deliberately typeless simplification series: the nearest creature
 * gets its own art and everything further out gets a generic silhouette, because at that

 *                           is silent and that silence is the original's.
 *   type 5  runtime 0x13DA  A GREMLIN STOLE SOME FOOD!  one BCD unit off the food triple.
 *   type 7  runtime 0x1410  YOU FEEL A STRONG MAGIC!    paral_sleep := rand & 7.

 *

 * points. Melee damage in a dungeon comes from your own ATTACK exchanges, exactly as the
 * overworld has no attack-on-contact (see ai.h). Every effect prints, which is what keeps
 * this project's "no silent mutation" rule satisfied by construction here.
 *
 * NOT modelled, and deliberately: the roll >= 0x40 branch does not go to the next slot, it

 * asm/60AC, rolls, masks to 0..7 and compares against [DS:62] — which state.h names
 * worn_armour. That is an armour-gated creature spell and it is a separate decode with
 * three unnamed helpers behind it (asm/60AC, asm/60F2, asm/4D26). Treating a failed roll
 * as "nothing happened" is a known understatement, named here rather than hidden.

 *
 * Rewritten 2026-10-29 after the owner reported monsters spawning too close. Three
 * mistakes in the first version, all of them visible in play:
 *
 *   THE STAMP WENT ON THE WRONG FLOOR. The original's cell pointer comes from asm/144C,
 *   which takes the floor from [DI+0x1B7], and that byte was just set to slot>>1 at
 *   runtime 0x16D6. So a dungeon populates all sixteen pages, roughly two creatures per
 *   page. The engine stamped everything on the PLAYER's floor instead, which is what
 *   "they spawn too close" actually was: creatures belonging to floors 1..15 were being
 *   drawn into your corridor.
 *
 *   THERE WAS NO TERRAIN GATE. Runtime 0x16DA calls asm/144C and takes `jne` to the next
 *   slot when the cell is non-zero, so a candidate must be EMPTY — not rock, not a chest,
 *   not another creature's stamp.
 *
 *   THE STAMP OVERWROTE THE CELL INSTEAD OF ORING INTO IT. Runtime 0x1721 is
 *   `or [DI+0x197],%al`. With the gate in place the two are equivalent for a legal spawn,
 *   but without it a write over 0x80 turned solid rock into a walkable stamped cell and
 *   could open phantom corridors.
 *
 * Also: one coordinate draw per slot, and a rejected slot is SKIPPED rather than retried.
 * The first version retried up to 32 times, spending RNG the original never spends and
 * diverging the whole dungeon's stream. Roll order is x, y, then the type.
 *
 * The formulas are unchanged and still agree with both the captures and the bytes: type
 * = (rand & 7) + 1 with 7 rejected and accepted iff 2*(type-1) <= slot>>1, and
 * HP = ((2*type + (slot>>1)) * 8) | 0x10. */
