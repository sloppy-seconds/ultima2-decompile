/*
 * dungeon.h — CP7: the interior sector. A first-person crawl over a paged grid.
 *
 * What a "dungeon" is, and how much of that is evidence
 * ----------------------------------------------------
 * A dungeon is not a separate mode of the game. It is an ordinary sector whose
 * filename ends in 4 or 5 — 24/34/44 are towers, 15/25/35/45/85 are caves — and
 * entering one loads mapxNN into the same 4096-byte grid buffer the overworld
 * uses and sets [DS:12] to 4. docs/sector-rulesets.md § 1 and § 1b established
 * that, and established that the split is {4,5} versus {0,1,2,3}.
 *
 * What is different inside one is everything this module owns:
 *
 *   The grid is 16 pages of 16x16 cells, not 64x64. asm/68C0 forms the cell
 *   address as map_base + floor*256 + y*16 + x with the offset truncated to one
 *   byte, and [DS:25] is the floor. Verified against captures/spice86/dungeon-35-live,
 *   whose live page 0 is byte-identical to original/mapx35's first 256 bytes.
 *
 *   A cell is two layers in one byte. The high nibble is terrain, the low nibble
 *   is whatever the loader stamped there. The four terrain bits read off the
 *   renderer's own tests and the two ladder commands:
 *       0x80 rock        — asm/6144 treats bit 7 as "the corridor ends here"
 *       0x40 chest       — GET's site arm compares the cell under the player to
 *                          '@' (0x40) and prints " CHEST!" (asm/363B, runtime 0x36C4)
 *       0x20 down ladder — cmd_D's gate is [DS:14] & 0x20
 *       0x10 up ladder   — cmd_K's gate is [DS:14] & 0x10
 *   The shipped mapx35 uses exactly seven values, all multiples of 0x10, and only
 *   seven of the sixteen combinations a free nibble would allow. That is a small
 *   enum, not an art index, and it is why the tile renderer has never covered this.
 *
 *   The view is a wireframe. asm/6000 renders, and it renders nothing at all when
 *   the light counter [DS:26] is zero — that branch is the darkness, and it is a
 *   byte, not an inference. When there is light it samples three columns of cells
 *   out to seven depths (asm/6078), picks a shape per depth from the cell bits
 *   (asm/6144), and draws each shape as one to nine straight lines out of eight
 *   depth tables in CS (asm/6291 .. asm/66CB, asm/67B3).
 *
 *   Movement is not a grid step in four directions. It is ADVANCE, RETREAT,
 *   TURN LEFT and TURN RIGHT, and the facing is a signed byte pair at [DS:02]/
 *   [DS:03], not an enum. asm/277B holds all four and they are transcribed here
 *   instruction for instruction, including the position wrap at $0x3f and the
 *   trap roll that follows a successful ADVANCE.
 *
 * What is NOT proven, and is marked at the site
 * --------------------------------------------
 *   * Which low-nibble stamp is which creature. The dungeon creature encoding is
 *     [DI+0x1B7] = slot >> 1 and a type of 1..7 (asm/147F, validated 54/54 slots
 *     by tools/dungeon_spawn_check.py), but the stamp values 0x01..0x07 written
 *     into the grid have never been joined to those types by a capture.
 *   * The sprite pass. asm/68ed walks the per-depth object array and draws from a
 *     stroke table at [DS:474] = DS:2900 — that is T9, still undecoded, and this
 *     module draws a placeholder box and says so rather than inventing outlines.
 *   * Whether `A` attacks or advances inside a site. The two captures disagree
 *     and disagree with the overworld: dungeon-35-live shows A = ADVANCE,
 *     tower-34 shows A = ATTACK--MISS, and asm/2B9B's gate compares [DS:4A] to 4
 *     in a direction that explains neither on its own. The rule implemented
 *     below is the one that reproduces both observations, and it names itself as
 *     inferred where it is used.
