/*
 * ai.h — the creature turn: pursuit, movement, and the special-attack gate.
 *
 * CP5 W6/W6b. Two passes over the 32 creature slots, both of them proven in the
 * bytes and both written up in docs/monster-spawn.md § 13:
 *
 *   asm/0A6D..0AB5  per slot: skip empty, compute the pursuit vector
 *                   (asm/4F36), and if |dx| < 3 and |dy| < 3 roll 1/8 for one of
 *                   the four specials (asm/0AAA gate, asm/0AD3 dispatch).
 *   asm/2122..2260  per slot: regenerate below 16 HP, then try to step along the
 *                   pursuit vector — diagonal first, then y-only, then x-only —
 *                   where each candidate must pass a per-species tile test.
 *
 * There is no "attack the player on contact" in the original. A creature whose
 * candidate cell is the player's cell does not move, and a thief in that
 * position attempts a steal (asm/0B4D -> asm/0FCD). Everything else about being
 * next to a monster is the player's problem, not the monster's.

 *
 *     113a  if [DS:4A] == 0 -> ret            ; the world map has no guards
 *     1142  di := 7 ; al := 1

 *
 * So violence inside a site sets role 1 on slots 0..7, and role 1 is the pass that
 * casts and chases while role 0 does nothing at all. That is the whole of the
 * sector-wide guard response measured in docs/spice86-live-findings.md § 16, and
 * it explains why a missed swing flips nothing: asm/2BE9 sits on the hit path,
 * before the "--HIT!!!" printer, and the miss path never reaches it.
 *
 * One arm is deliberately not reproduced. The loop falls through into asm/1151,
 * which writes the same 1 into mon_role[DS:20] — and DS:20 is the damage byte on
 * the attack path and a poll counter elsewhere, so what slot it names here is not
 * established. Writing a slot on an unproven index is worse than not writing it.
