 *
 * On foot the byte is NOT a constant: asm/080D computes it as `mov 0x47,%al ; add
 * %al,%al ; clc ; adc $0x78,%al`, i.e. 0x78 + 2*pclass, so the four classes sit at
 * 0x78/0x7A/0x7C/0x7E. Every capture has read 0x78 because every capture used a
 * Fighter, and the mounted test everywhere in the binary is `cmp $0x78,%al` with the
 * mounted arm being the `jb` side — so anything below 0x78 is a vehicle and anything
 * at or above it is a class. That test is what the engine uses; the class-dependent
 * value itself is recorded and NOT applied, because no caller of asm/080D has been
 * found and where it runs is therefore unproven.
