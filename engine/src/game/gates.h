/*
 * Time doors (moongates) — the overworld era transit.
 *
 * Everything in this header is a live observation from 2026-10-29, graded in
 * docs/moongates.md. Read that file before changing anything here: the mechanic was
 * refuted by an earlier document in this repo on a census that looked only at stores
 * of the byte, and it is easy to re-introduce that mistake.
 *
 * SCOPE, and it is deliberate. The table is decoded for all five eras, but only two
 * gate indices have an OBSERVED partner era: index 1 pairs eras 1 and 2, index 2 pairs
 * eras 2 and 3. Indices 0 and 3 are unobserved, so u2_gate_partner_era() reports them
 * as unknown and no transit is offered there. A door that opens onto a guessed era is
 * worse than no door: it reads as finished and is silently wrong, which is the failure
 * mode AGENTS.md § 3 was written against.
 *
 * Also deliberately NOT modelled: stamping 0xC0 into the resident sector. Two reasons,
 * both recorded in docs/moongates.md § 7. The substitute art for that byte is under
 * cleanroom control, and writing into the resident grid marks the sector dirty — while
 * whether the original persists a stamped gate into mapxNN on a save is untested.

 * Do NOT attribute this to asm/2744. An earlier revision of this file cited that routine,
 * and a stop armed at 17D:2908 across observed rotations refuted the attribution the same

 * worth recording because a countdown that reloads to 8 looks like it should start at 8.
 *
 * And before anyone waits for a rotation to happen on its own: from 0x00 the byte wraps to
 * 0xff and needs roughly 255 turns before the first expiry — about 25 minutes of standing

 * also what puts a door on the map, so this is what sets ow->gate_stamped; before the
 * first expiry there is no door anywhere, which is how the original behaves at load.
 *
 * The unit is TURNS, and that is measured rather than assumed: 12 direction keys sent one
 * at a time with a 0.55 s gap all landed, and DS:6F fell by exactly 12 — 1.00 drops per
 * landed turn — while idling 20 s moved it only 2 (captures/spice86/turn-or-second).
 * Standing still looks like a slow clock because a turn also ends on the idle auto-PASS
 * timeout (asm/08FF), measured at about one every 10 s. So the recalled "every 8 turns"
 * was right throughout; an earlier note here "corrected" it to time and was itself wrong.
 * It also means the engine's turn-driven loop needs no substitution — the original counts
 * turns and so does this.

 *
 * Returns 0 with nothing done until the first rotation has stamped a door — at load the
 * index points at slot 0 but no gate exists, and transiting there would be a door the
 * original does not have.
 *
 * Returns 1 when a transit happened. There is no prompt and no key: the original
 * consumed the player within one tick of the step onto the cell, which is the opposite
 * of a town or tower gate and is why this is called from the move path and not from
