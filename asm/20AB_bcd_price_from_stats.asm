# bcd_price_from_stats — derives a BCD amount into DS:27/28 from int + charisma
# name-evidence: seeds the price pair DS:27/28 AND a second pair DS:29/2A to 0004,
#           derives a loop count from the bit length of [DS:50]+[DS:4E] (int + the
#           byte at DS:4E -- see DOUBT, its identity is disputed), then runs a
#           swap-and-add BCD sequence DI times, leaving the result in DS:27/28 -- the
#           same operand pair asm/17B7 hands to the 4-digit BCD printer and asm/2052
#           charges. Three inbound callers: 17B2 (the tavern food quote),
#           1869_cleric_shrine, 19D7_magic_shop_menu. All three are places a price is
#           quoted.

# MERGED 2026-10-23 from the fragments 20AB, 20CF, 20D7, 20EB and 2121, per
# docs/g22-split-proposal.md § 2 with the owner's approval. 20AB is the only inbound
# call target in the range and 2121 is the terminating `ret`. Body lines unchanged and
# in address order; engine/tests/asm_body_guard.py proves it.
#
# HOW IT WORKS (observed, and simulated step by step)
#   20AB  clc; adc $0x8,%al ; mov %al,[DS:20]     DS:20 = caller_AL + 8 + CF
#         [DS:27],[DS:29] = 0 ; [DS:28],[DS:2A] = 4      two BCD pairs, both 0004
#         mov al,[DS:50] ; adc al,[DS:4E]         AL = int + cha + CF
#   20CF  inc %si ; clc ; rcr $1,%al ; or %al,%al ; jne
#         SI = number of right shifts to reach zero = the BIT LENGTH of int+cha
#   20D7  mov al,[DS:20]     (reads the OLD DS:20, before the next line overwrites it)
#         mov %bl,[DS:20]    DS:20 = bit length
#         stc; cmc; sbb [DS:20],%al; cmc          AL = (caller_AL+8+CF) - bitlength
#         mov $0,%ah ; mov %ax,%di                DI = loop count
#   20EB  loop, DI times:
#           al = [DS:2A] + [DS:28], das
#           [DS:2A] = old [DS:28] ; [DS:28] = al
#           al = [DS:29] + [DS:27] + CF, das
#           [DS:29] = old [DS:27] ; [DS:27] = al
#         dec %di ; jne
#   2121  ret
#
#   The loop is NOT multiply-by-repeated-addition, which is what a first reading
#   called it. Each pair takes the other pair's old value while the first receives
#   the sum, so the two pairs walk a Fibonacci sequence seeded 4,4:
#       DS:27/28 after DI iterations = 4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, 84, 136, 220, 356, 576, 932 ...
#   Simulated for the tavern call (caller_AL=3) on a maxed character (int=cha=0x40,
#   BCD 0x40+0x40=0x80, bit length 8): DI = 11-8 = 3 -> DS:27/28 = 0020.
#   A character with int=cha=0 gets DI = 10 -> 0576. **Higher int+cha means a LOWER
#   number.** The owner confirms on 2026-10-23 that charisma affecting costs is known
#   game behaviour, which is the strongest support this reading has; it is corroboration
#   of direction, not proof of the arithmetic.
#
# DOUBT -- read this before citing the routine, and note two retractions inside it
#   * THIRD-PARTY CORROBORATION, 2026-10-28e, and it is the strongest support this file has.
#     The owner supplied grocery data from the Ultima II wiki: every grocery sells
#     "Provisions (100)" for **52 gp**, that 52 is the MAXIMUM price (charged when Charisma and
#     Intelligence are both at their minimum of 10), and that **the higher both stats, the lower
#     the price**. Two independent things about that match this routine, and neither was known
#     when the routine was decoded:
#       - the DIRECTION agrees. Higher int+cha shortens the shift count, which lengthens DI,
#         which walks the Fibonacci pair further -- wait, the opposite: a larger sum has a
#         LONGER bit length, so DI = (AL+8+CF) - bitlength gets SMALLER and the price gets
#         LOWER. The wiki says exactly that, from a source that never saw these bytes.
#       - the NUMBER agrees. The values this loop can produce are
#             4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, 84, 136, 220, 356, 576, 932, ...
#         and **52 is the 6th of them**. Worked at the wiki's minimum stats (int=cha=0x10, so
#         adc gives 0x20, bit length 6): DI = (AL+8+CF) - 6, and AL=4 yields DI=6 -> DS:27/28
#         = 0052. A caller with AL=4 on a minimum-stat character prints 52.
#     This does NOT close the DOUBT above: the tavern observation of '0200' is still
#     unreproduced, and 200 is still not in the sequence. What it does do is make "this routine
#     computes a quoted price" considerably harder to dismiss, and it suggests the tavern quote
#     and the grocery price may not consume the same call at all -- different callers pass
#     different AL (17B2 passes 3), so comparing the tavern's printed number against the
#     grocery's expected 52 may have been a category error.
#     Grade: corroboration of direction and of one reachable value, from a third-party source.
#     Still not bytes. The DS:4E charisma-vs-wisdom dispute is untouched by it -- the wiki names
#     charisma, which is a second reason to hope the label is right, and still not proof.
#   * WHICH STAT IS [DS:4E] IS NOT SETTLED, and this file's name leans on it.
#     tools/u2_edit.py records the dispute: engine/src/core/state.h labels DS:4E
#     charisma and DS:4F wisdom, docs/spice86-live-findings.md lists them the other way
#     round, and it cannot be resolved from a character where both bytes are equal --
#     which is every maxout character ever seeded here, including the one used for this
#     analysis. So "int + cha" here means "int + [DS:4E]", and if the labels are swapped
#     the mechanic is int + WISDOM. The owner's recollection is that CHARISMA moves
#     prices; that is a reason to hope this is charisma, not proof of it. Do not rename
#     this file on the strength of the recollection alone. A capture that sets DS:4E and
#     DS:4F to DIFFERENT values and watches the price settles it.
#   * RETRACTED (same day, twice): this routine was first described as deriving its
#     count from `popcount(int + cha)` and as a "multiply by repeated addition".
#     Both were wrong. The shift loop counts shifts, not set bits, and the loop is a
#     Fibonacci walk, not a multiply. The first simulation of it also had DAA
#     subtracting 6 instead of adding, which produced plausible nonsense (01A6 where
#     the answer is 0012) -- a good illustration of why a model must be checked
#     against a hand-computed case before it is quoted.
#   * THE MODEL DOES NOT REPRODUCE THE OBSERVED PRICE, and the gap is now known to be
#     real rather than a misreading of the print. asm/17B7 was decoded on 2026-10-23 --
#     it turned out to be TWO more fragment-splits of exactly the G22 kind (51A5/51A9/
#     51AE and 53B5/53C5 are one 4-digit BCD printer each, cut on branch targets). It
#     emits DS:27 as two decimal digits, then DS:28 as two. So the observed '0200' means
#     DS:27=0x02, DS:28=0x00, and this routine called from asm/17B2 with AL=3 on a maxed
#     character leaves DS:27/28 = 0020.
#     Worse than transposed: the values this loop can ever produce are
#         4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, 84, 136, 220, 356, 576, 932, ...
#     and **200 is not among them at any loop count**. On the current model this routine
#     cannot output the number the game printed. Either the food quote does not consume
#     this routine's result, or the loop is still misread, or the printed string was not
#     0200. Unresolved; G23 carries it. Do not describe this routine as "the price
#     formula" until it reproduces a number the game actually printed.
#   * Which of DS:27 / DS:28 is the high byte is now PROVEN by the printer rather than
#     inferred from asm/2052: asm/17B7 loads AL=DS:27 and DI=DS:28 and the printer emits
#     AL's two digits first. It agrees with the asm/2052 pairing. The residual doubt in
#     the bullet above is about the loop, not about the byte order.
#   * If DI computes to 0 the loop's `dec %di ; jne` wraps to 0xFFFF and runs 65536
#     times. Reachable in principle (caller_AL+8+CF == bitlength) and never observed.
#     Untested; do not assume the original guarded it.
#   * int and cha are read as raw BCD bytes and added with `adc`, not with `daa`, so
#     the sum is a binary add of two packed-decimal bytes. For 0x40+0x40 that is 0x80,
#     which happens to be a valid BCD byte; for 0x99+0x99 it is 0x32 with carry, which
#     is not. Whether that is a deliberate quirk or a sloppy add is unknown, and it
#     changes the curve for high stats.
#   * Six instructions in here are `forced-kept` byte sequences -- the vendored
#     assembler re-encodes those movs differently, so the listing stores the original
#     machine words and the mnemonics are our reading. check_func.py proves the bytes
#     round-trip, not the disassembly.
# bulk wave: L_<addr> labels kept as cross-reference anchors (CP3)
