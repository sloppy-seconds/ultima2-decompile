# sub_2744 — mechanical clean (bulk wave); behavior not yet reviewed
# DECODED 2026-10-29: the mismatch path, and the only place in the tree where the number 8 and a
#           mod-8 counter appear together in a way that matches a live observation. Reached when
#           asm/2731 does NOT find `0xC0`. It sets DS:6F = 8, adds 2 to DS:6E, masks it with
#           `and $0x7,%al`, stores it back, then rebuilds the index from DS:1F and loads the next
#           candidate cell from the same table and re-tests it.
#           OBSERVED 2026-10-29 (docs/moongates.md § 2, captures/spice86/moongate-cycle): the
#           live rotation behaves exactly like this. DS:6F reloads to precisely 8 and then
#           decrements about every 4.2 s with the player standing still, and DS:6E steps
#           00 -> 02 -> 04 -> 06 -> 00, each value selecting the next cell of the era-2 row of
#           the table at file 0x2998. Four cells matched four table entries in index order,
#           and with a third era watched live the model is now 12/12 — see docs/moongates.md § 3.
#           CORRECTION to a recalled detail worth recording: the cycle is TIME, not turns. The
#           countdown ran at a steady rate with no input at all, so "every 8 steps" is wrong in
#           the unit even though the 8 is right.
#           ATTRIBUTION REFUTED 2026-10-29 — see asm/2708. The listing's shape matched the live
#           rotation and that match was coincidence, not causation: a stop at 17D:2908 never
#           fired across a window in which the gate rotated twice. The OBSERVED paragraph above
#           stands on its own measurements and is nothing to do with this file.
