# cast_spell_flow — the CAST gates and the per-spell dispatch. NOT one routine.
# name-evidence: strings 'NEED WAND OR STAFF!' / 'NO SPELL!' / '-FAILED!'; cmd_C jumps into
#           this range at runtime 0x3153.
# BOUNDARY, corrected 2026-10-25: this file's declared start is wrong by design of the bulk
#           wave and the name covers two unrelated things. Runtime 0x3139..~0x3152 is
#           `sub_3339`, a SEGMENT helper — the caller passes a segment in AX, it sets ES to
#           it and works at offset 0x1900 — and its only callers are the dead block in
#           asm/310B_cmd_C.asm (video segment 0xB800, then 0xBA00). The CAST body starts at
#           runtime 0x3153, which is where cmd_C actually lands. Splitting them needs a new
#           row in disasm/function-map.tsv, so it is recorded here rather than done silently;
#           until then do not read 0x3139 as part of the cast flow.
# THE GATES, in byte order (all of this is read off the listing, not inferred):
#           1. print pool[0x24 + DS:63] — the readied spell's NAME, from the SPELLS group of
#              the indexed name pool (asm/4C55_name_pool.asm: NONE, LIGHT, DOWN LADDER,
#              UP LADDER, PASSWALL, SURFACE, PRAYER, MAGIC MISSILE, BLINK, KILL at pool[36..45]).
#           2. DS:D7 + DS:D8 must be non-zero, else 'NEED WAND OR STAFF!'. Neither byte is
#              modelled in engine/src/core/state.h yet.
#           3. DS:63 (the readied slot) zero -> return silently, no message at all.
#           4. DS:B6[DS:63] must be non-zero, else 'NO SPELL!'.
#           5. decrement DS:B6[DS:63] by 1 in packed decimal — spells are CONSUMABLE counts,
#              which is the same array the Z screen lists (docs/status-screen-z.md § 7).
#           6. DS:4A must be >= 4, else '-FAILED!'. DS:4A is the site kind: 0 world map,
#              1 village, 2 town, 3 castle, 4 tower, 5 dungeon. So CASTING ONLY WORKS IN A
#              TOWER OR A DUNGEON. That single byte explains the 2026-10-25 capture, whose
#              seed was standing on the world map.
#           7. dispatch on DS:63: 1 -> sets DS:26 = 0x96 (150), which is the dungeon light
#              step counter, and independently corroborates the owner's '~150 on I'
#              recollection from a completely different direction; 2 and 3 (DOWN/UP LADDER)
#              move DS:25 against a 0xf bound and additionally require DS:4A == 4; 4..9 branch
#              on into the rest of the range.
# LADDER ARMS, re-read from the bytes and WALKED 2026-10-29 (captures/spice86/d12-ladder-ds25).
#           The earlier one-line summary above was loose in three places, all corrected here.
#           1. The `cmp $0xf,%al` bound is tested on a reload of DS:25, not on DS:4A, and the
#              value handed to the validity call is DS:25 +/- 1 — the candidate floor.
#           2. The validity call is asm/1451_site_cell_open_on_floor: it reads the cell at
#              DS:23/DS:24 on the CANDIDATE floor and the callers fail on `jne`, so the move is
#              allowed only when that byte is ZERO (open). That is why UP LADDER printed
#              -FAILED! at the sector-24 tower entry cell (floor 1 there is 0x80, a wall) and
#              succeeded at a cell where floor 1 is open.
#           3. Tower and dungeon are SWAPPED. Slot 2 (DOWN LADDER) takes the decrement path only
#              when DS:4A == 4 and otherwise falls into the increment path; slot 3 (UP LADDER)
#              jumps to the increment path when DS:4A == 4 and otherwise decrements. So in a
#              dungeon the two spells do the opposite of what they do in a tower. Observed in a
#              tower only: UP took DS:25 0 -> 1, DOWN took it back 1 -> 0, UP again 0 -> 1.
#           Also observed: at DS:25 == 0 the DOWN LADDER arm branches away (L_0034a2) instead of
#           decrementing, and cmd_D (pressing D on a 0x20 down-ladder cell) left the site to the
#           world map and left DS:25 at 0xFF — a decrement with no guard at the bottom.
#           There is no key read, no direction and no cursor anywhere in steps 1-7. CAST aims
#           at nothing; the spells that need a position are dungeon-side.
# CAPTURE-CONFIRMED 2026-10-29 — captures/spice86/cmd-c-cast-tower/ (wizard MAGUS, the tower in
#           sector 20, live frames). Three things the listing allowed but never forced anyone to
#           notice, all of them engine-relevant:
#           (a) **a failed cast still spends the spell.** On the world map `C` printed
#              `CAST-LIGHT-FAILED!` and the LIGHT count went 9 -> 8. Gate 5 (the decrement) runs
#              before gate 6 (`DS:4A >= 4`), so an implementation that checks the location first
#              and spends after — the natural way to write it — is wrong, and only a test that
#              counts stock would catch it.
#           (b) the NAME prints before every gate: with nothing readied, `C` printed `CAST-NONE`
#              rather than a refusal, because pool[36] is NONE and step 1 is unconditional.
#           (c) LIGHT has no darkness precondition and always spends: casting it in a lit corridor
#              consumed another charge and reset DS:26 to 0x96. "Cast LIGHT when it's dark" is a
#              play habit, not a rule.
# ONE SPELL LIST, TWO SHOPPED CATALOGUES (the cleric/wizard difference, 2026-10-29). The ten
#           names in pool[36..45] are the whole spell vocabulary and both classes draw from it; what
#           differs is what each is offered. asm/1869_cleric_shrine sells
#           `1-LIGHT, 2-L.D., 3-L.U., 4-PASS 5-SURFACE, 6-PRAYER` and asm/19D7_magic_shop_menu
#           sells `1-LIGHT, 2-L.D., 3-L.U., 4-M.M., 5-BLINK, 6-KILL`. So three are shared (LIGHT,
#           DOWN LADDER, UP LADDER), three are cleric-only (PASSWALL, SURFACE, PRAYER) and three
#           wizard-only (MAGIC MISSILE, BLINK, KILL). The class gate is the pair of refusals
#           asm/184C (` YOU ARE NOT A CLERIC!`) and asm/19BA (` YOU ARE NOT A WIZARD!`).
#           INFERRED, and cheap to settle: the cleric menu numbers land on slots 1..6 exactly, but
#           the wizard's 4/5/6 name spells that live at pool[43..45], i.e. slots 7/8/9. If that is
#           right, a wizard who buys "6-KILL" must ready it with M 9, not M 6. One capture settles
#           it: buy a spell at the magic shoppe and read DS:B6[1..9] before and after.
#           Class values themselves come from pool[72..75] = FIGHTER, CLERIC, WIZARD, THIEF — not
#           "mage"/"paladin", which is corrected in asm/080D_sub_080d.asm and tools/u2_edit.py.
#           Also learned the hard way from this capture: the 3D view does not redraw on a move that
#           did not land, so two frames showed a stale IT'S DARK* after an illegal arrow and an
#           ADVANCE-BLOCKED. A dungeon frame is only evidence after a move that actually moved.
# THIRD-PARTY CROSS-CHECK 2026-10-29 (a class/spell write-up the owner supplied). Graded against
#           these bytes, and the grades are deliberately not merged into the claims above:
#           PROVEN, and more precisely than the claim: BLINK. L_0034d2 calls the rand seam twice,
#           `and $0xf ; or $0x1` each result (random ODD 1..15) into DS:23/DS:24, runs a validity
#           call (L_001651) that can fail into the -FAILED! path at L_003432, and then writes
#           DS:23 -> DS:00 and DS:24 -> DS:01. It overwrites the player position directly.
#           ATTRIBUTED 2026-10-29, and the "not attributed" above is RETRACTED: the
#           creature-HP subtract at L_0034bc is MAGIC MISSILE. Slot 7 dispatches to
#           L_0034ad, which calls the target scan (asm/330C_cast_target_finder.asm) and
#           on a match computes the amount and subtracts it. Live, headless, in
#           captures/spice86/cmd-c-magic-missile:
#             amount: DS:20 = 2*DS:56 + 0x1e + CF, and the `cmc ; sbb` idiom subtracts
#           DS:20 + 1, not DS:20. Measured at two points and both exact: DS:56 = 0x99
#           gives DS:20 = 0x51 and HP 0x99 -> 0x47; DS:56 = 0x01 gives DS:20 = 0x20 and
#           HP 0x99 -> 0x78.
#             "scales with level" is wrong in shape, not just unproven: DS:56 is the HIGH
#           BCD byte of experience (state.h, with its naming wart recorded), there is no
#           level field, and a binary doubling of a BCD digit is not monotone — 0x99
#           yields 82 damage and 0x01 yields 33.
#             survived -> the slot keeps the reduced HP and NOTHING prints. died (HP <=
#           the amount) -> L_0030d1 clears mon_hp/mon_type/mon_kind and the frame reads
#           `KILLED--GOLD+3--EXP.+00`, the gold awarded in BCD and wrapping: a 9999-gold
#           character went to 0002 on +3. EXP.+00 because the synthetic slot used for the
#           test carried no kind table entry — the award itself is not decoded.
#             The `jb` after the second `cmc` is taken when the creature SURVIVED, the
#           opposite of how the idiom reads at a glance; invert it and the death path
#           looks like the survival path.
#           KILL (slot 9) AND BLINK (slot 8) OBSERVED 2026-10-29 —
#           captures/spice86/g46-kill-blink, same tower, same rig.
#           KILL: L_003501 calls the same target scan and, on a match, jumps straight to the
#           death path with NO damage step. Proven by the discriminator: a creature held at
#           full HP 0x99 — which MAGIC MISSILE leaves alive at 0x47 — had its slot erased
#           outright (mon_hp 0, mon_type 0). The frame shows the award landing on the
#           character: GOLD 9999 -> 0006 and EXP 9999 -> 0001, both wrapped BCD, so KILL
#           does pay out and the amount comes from the creature's own entry.
#           BLINK: both exits observed. The random odd cell is rejected as often as not
#           (`CAST-BLINK-FAILED!` on attempt 1), and on attempt 2 the position went
#           (5,5) -> (7,15) — both odd, inside 1..15, exactly the `and $0xf ; or $0x1`
#           shape. So "BLINK can fail" is confirmed and the gate is the same asm/1451
#           site-cell validity call the ladder spells use, not a separate rule.
#           Still unobserved in this file: PASSWALL (4), SURFACE (5) and PRAYER (6).
#           NOT FOUND: a 50%-shaped test for PRAYER, a grid write for PASSWALL, an exit-to-surface
#           path for SURFACE. Absence in this header is not absence in the binary — the branches
#           from 4..9 run on into the rest of the range and dungeons are parked (AGENTS.md § 3).
#           CORROBORATED ELSEWHERE: the class bonuses are exact (CLERIC +10 WIS at file 0x5AD5,
#           WIZARD +10 INT at 0x5B04, FIGHTER +15 STR, THIEF +10 AGI, and STAMINA gets no bonus
#           from sex, race or class at all) — see engine/src/game/creation.c. And shop price is
#           COMPUTED, not tabulated: asm/20AB_bcd_price_from_stats derives it from the caller's
#           index and the bit length of [DS:50] + [DS:4E], so a fixed per-spell cost like "576 gold
#           for KILL" cannot exist, and a high-INT buyer is quoted less for the same spell. Both
#           spell shops call the same function, so expense tracks index and stats, not class.
