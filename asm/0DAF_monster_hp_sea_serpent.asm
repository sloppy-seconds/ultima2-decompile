# monster_hp_sea_serpent — spawn arm: assigns monster type 0x2C and HP 64
# name-evidence: `mov $0x2c,%al` stored to [DI+0x197] and stamped into the map cell,
#           then `mov $0x40,%al` stored to [DI+0x177] (monster HP, proven by
#           asm/2E3D_combat_attack_flow). Type 0x2C >> 2 == art 0x0B, named Sea
#           serpent / Sea Monster by bitmap identity, third-party HP 64.
#           NOTE art 0x0B carries a standing dispute (see docs/bestiary.md § 8):
#           tile-art.tsv reads it as a doorway, not a creature. The HP value is not
#           in dispute; what the art depicts is.
# provenance: static, 2026-10-22; extracted by tools/monster_hp_dispatch.py
# confidence: high for the field and the value (bytes)
# label: kept as sub_0daf on purpose — labels are body (CP0)
# GUARD BYTE: this arm wants terrain 0x00 — water. It and the Frigate arm in
#   asm/0DC4 are the only two that do, and they are the only two sea creatures, which is the
#   strongest single corroboration that [DI+0x1B7] is the tile and not an index.
#   RUNTIME CONFIRMED 2026-10-28: with DS:60 forced so the chain saw 0x08, three sea serpents
#   appeared at mapx20 cells that all read 0x00. docs/monster-spawn.md 15.4.
