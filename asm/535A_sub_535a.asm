# sub_535a — an INT 21h FCB read of one record into DS:0x245, sitting in the picture load
# name-evidence: `pop %ds` restores the data segment that asm/5351_sub_5351.asm had pointed at
#           the framebuffer, then `lea 0x245,%dx` sets the transfer buffer, `movw $0x1,0x253`
#           sets an FCB record count of one, and the function number is taken from a table at
#           CS:4F04 (with CS:4F05 feeding CX) rather than being a literal -- the same
#           table-driven DOS call shape the sector reads elsewhere in this binary use.
# What is NOT claimed, and why the file keeps its placeholder name: a pic file is 16,384 bytes
#           of mode-4 video (32 sectors of 512), and this read asks for ONE record into a fixed
#           offset. Either the picture arrives through a path this routine is not part of, or it
#           arrives in many one-record reads with the buffer advanced by a caller that has not
#           been identified. Both are consistent with the bytes and neither is established, so
#           "pic_read" would overstate it. The empirical fact stands on its own regardless: the
#           files are literal mode-4 framebuffer images, proven by decoding picdra against a
#           live capture at 100% colour-class agreement (see asm/5351's header and
#           engine/src/core/pic.h).
