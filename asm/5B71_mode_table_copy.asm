# mode_table_copy — fills the movement mode bytes from a table, and swaps DS:13
# name-evidence: raw scan of the exe for direct writers of DS:15 and DS:18 (2026-10-21).
#           This block is the origin of the value the walk loop hands to 0x2423:
#           DS:2CB -> DS:15, DS:2DE -> DS:18, DS:2DF <-> DS:13, plus DS:16/DS:17
#           from DS:2F3/DS:2E0. A parallel block at runtime 0x5C4F does the same.
# OPEN: DS:2CB, DS:2DE, DS:2E0 and DS:2F3 have NO direct writers anywhere in the
#           exe (checked A2/A3/C6-06 forms over the whole file). They are filled
#           by an indirect store, and that is where the tile dependence of
#           passability must enter. Unresolved; docs/passability-findings.md F3.
# APPLE2: no equivalent, and that is the answer the ticket was waiting for (2026-10-28,
#           docs/handoff-apple2-crosswalk.md Q4). Three targeted scans of the resident 6502
#           image: no run of 3+ `LDA abs ; STA zp` copy pairs anywhere (this block's shape);
#           no `LSR A ; TAX ; LDA abs,X` anywhere (a tile>>1-indexed table read, which is the
#           shape the mode would have to arrive in); and the bytes corresponding to DS:17/DS:18
#           on the Apple side, $17/$18, are written only directly by the routines that compute
#           them — the step vector at $405F/$406C and its callers — never copied out of a
#           table. $15/$16 have no writers at all in the resident set. So the Apple build has
#           no table-with-no-static-writers behind the movement scratch, and this block is a
#           DOS-port construction. The watchpoint ticket on DS:2CB/2DE/2E0/2F3 is closed as a
#           DOS-port artefact, not spent an afternoon on; it was already dead on its own terms,
#           since 0x5C >> 1 == 0x2e explains the mode without it. GRADE: a null result from
#           shape scans, i.e. Apple-silent — it does not prove the DOS side is wrong, only
#           that there is no second witness to find here.
