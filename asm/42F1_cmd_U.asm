# cmd_U — command handler 'U': prints "UNLOCK DIRECTION-" then falls through
# The prompt is real and it is a RACE, not a menu. The fall-through calls the direction
#   reader at runtime 2370..2392, which polls for a key with AH == 0xFF (a BIOS extended
#   scancode) and matches AL against the four arrow scancodes held in DS:0x26E..0x271; on
#   success it prints the direction and sets the DS:19/DS:1A deltas, and on counter wrap it
#   prints PASS and leaves DS:19 at zero, which asm/4309 then refuses. Observed live
#   2026-10-28: `U` then a one-second pause then an arrow gave "UNLOCK DIRECTION-Pass" and
#   the arrow was eaten as an ordinary move; `U` and the arrow in one burst with a 0.05 s gap
#   unlocked the door. An agent driving this must send the pair together.
