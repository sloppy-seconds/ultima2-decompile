# cmd_V — command handler 'V' (VIEW): "VIEW WHAT?"; with magical helm shows
#           "VIEW\x8dWITH MAGICAL HELM!" variant.
# func 437E..43F2  len 0075 B  evidence: seed+reko (jump table cs:0730 entry V)
# provenance: live: cmd_V executed in captures/spice86/wvcap/ and wvcap-live/, observed 2026-10-26.
#           entry executed in 4 of 178 harvests; derived by tools/provenance_from_traces.py
#           Entry 0x437E is present in both harvests' ExecutedInstructions, and so is 0x4396 — the
#           MAGICAL HELM branch, not just the refusal.
#           OBSERVED ON SCREEN 2026-10-26 (captures/spice86/vhelm/, frame v_helm_view.png). With
#           DS:DB read as 01 BEFORE the press and DS:4A = 00, pressing V replaced the whole play
#           field with a **world map** — continents in white on black, filling the screen — with the
#           CMD window beneath reading `CMD: VIEW` / `WITH MAGICAL HELM!`. DS:DB read 00 afterwards,
#           so the charge is spent by the view, not by a later action. A subsequent press with the
#           counter at zero takes the 0x4585 refusal and prints VIEW WHAT?.
#           RETRACTION: an earlier version of this header said the render was "not captured" and
#           offered a whole-SECTOR view as consistent with the code shape. It is not a sector view.
#           The frame refutes it, and the mistake was reading memory and a cut-off text fragment and
#           then writing the inference down as though it had been watched. Memory says what changed;
#           only the screen says what the player saw. Those two disagreed here.
#           STILL NOT DECODED: how the map is produced. The body sets DS:23/24 to 0x20,0x20, calls
#           L_002bd2, waits on L_00514d until AH == 0xFF, then clears two 256-byte tables at 0x272
#           and 0x372 and tail-jumps to the tick. The wait-for-key and the two table clears match a
#           modal overlay that is torn down on a keypress, which the frame agrees with, but the
#           source of the continent art is unidentified — it is not the sector grid, and it is not
#           the tile atlas.
#           The gate is `cmp $0x4,%al; jae` on DS:4A, i.e. the sector's second decimal digit must
#           be below 4. That is NOT the same axis as "towns and castles", which the engine derives
#           from the tile under the player (site_kind). Recorded as an open discrepancy rather than
#           resolved in favour of the recollection.
# confidence: medium (flow + messages proven by bytes; NPC/quest semantics inferred)
# notes: re-decoded with tools/decode_str.py (str_out-aware); gas re-encode diffs
#        kept as .byte (disp8/disp16 and reg-op form choices)
