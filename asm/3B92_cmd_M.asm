# cmd_M — command handler 'M': prints "MAGIC SPELL READY #", reads one decimal digit,
#           stores it at DS:63 as the readied spell slot, prints "SPELL READY => " followed
#           by that spell's NAME, and returns to the dispatcher.
# CORRECTION 2026-10-25: the old header guessed "(call sub_508c = numeric out?)" and the
#           inline comment called `adc $0x24,%al` an "ASCII digit bias for numeric out".
#           It is neither. asm/508C is the INDEXED NAME POOL printer — it takes the entry
#           index in AL — and 0x24 is the SPELLS group base, the same constant cmd_C uses two
#           instructions after printing the spell name. So M echoes the NAME of the spell it
#           just readied: `MAGIC SPELL READY #3` then `SPELL READY => UP LADDER`. Nothing
#           numeric is printed, and 0x24 is not a digit bias. Getting this wrong would put a
#           number where the game puts a word, which is the kind of small confident mistake
#           this tree keeps having to take back.
