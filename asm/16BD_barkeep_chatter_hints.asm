# barkeep_chatter_hints — NUL-separated bar chatter and hint table, indexed by a cursor
# name-evidence: the tavern menu's tail does `lea ax,cs:0x16bc ; mov ds:0x27,ax` and calls
#           asm/155D, which walks the table at [DS:27:28] skipping SI entries and emitting
#           the one it lands on. Entry 0 is the first string here. The three chatter lines
#           and the seven hints are the game's own text; see docs/third-party-claims.md § 3.
# func 16BD..1798  len 00DC B  evidence: re-cut 2026-10-25 from asm/15E1_tavern_menu.asm
# strings: "CAUGH..."; "ISN'T THIS A GREAT GAME?"; "HHMMM..."; "SOME FIGHTERS WEAR MAGIC HELMS!";
#          "AVIATORS USE SKULL KEYS!"; "SAYLORS WEAR BLUE TASSLES!"; "MAGES NEED WANDS OR STAFFS!";
#          "GUARDS CARRY KEYS!"; "ANKHS OPEN SPACE"; "PLANES NEED BRASS BUTTONS!"
# provenance: static
#           nothing here has been seen to run: 0x16BD and the selector at 0x155D are absent from
#           ExecutedInstructions of all 142 harvests that carry a flow dump, as is the caller.
#           The decode is read, not observed -- the table's CONTENT is certain (the bytes and the
#           group-base arithmetic both pin it) but which entry the game actually prints, and when,
#           is unverified. That is a capture away from being settled: walk into a tavern and talk
#           to the barkeep. See docs/needs-gameplay.md.
# confidence: high (bytes proven by check_func.py; the cursor write and the walker are both
#             read directly, and no immediate in the file points at any entry -- which is why
#             an address-reference search alone wrongly makes this look like dead data)
# body corrected: 2026-10-25 -- evidence: the span 16BD..1798 is ten NUL-separated strings, not code.
#           The old decode ran the disassembler off the end of the tavern menu and invented
#           instructions out of the bytes of "SOME FIGHTERS WEAR MAGIC HELMS!" and friends.
#           Independent check: the ten entry starts sit at exactly the running sums of the
#           string lengths plus their terminators, which cannot happen by accident over 220
#           bytes. The reachability proof is the `lea cs:0x16bc ; mov ds:0x27,ax` pair at
#           runtime 0x16a8..0x16af and the walker at asm/155D_sub_155d.asm.
# note: the cursor is set to 0x16bc, ONE byte before the first entry -- the NUL that ends the
#           tavern menu's own code. The walker skips to the next NUL before it starts counting,
#           so that leading NUL is what puts entry 0 at 0x16bd. Do not "fix" the off-by-one.
# note: DS:27:28 is shared scratch. docs/commerce.md § 3b measured it as the price operand on
#           the shop path; here the same two bytes hold a code-segment cursor. Same aliasing
#           hazard as DS:1F, which has twenty-plus writers.
