# find_creature_at_cursor — scan the 32 creature slots for one standing at player+delta
# name-evidence: seeds DS:23/24 to [DS:00]+[DS:19] and [DS:01]+[DS:1A], sets DI=31, then
#           loops DI downward comparing [DI+0x197] (type, skip if 0), [DI+0x137] (x) and
#           [DI+0x157] (y) against the cursor. Returns at 241E with DI = the matching
#           slot, or falls out at 2422 with DI == 0 when the scan exhausts. Three inbound
#           callers: asm/4050_cmd_T (runtime 4060), asm/2BC4, asm/35F0.
# func 23E6..2422  len 003D B  evidence: seed+call+reko
# provenance: static; reached live by the 2026-10-23 armour purchase (cmd_T path)
# confidence: high -- the loop is nine instructions and its two exits explain the branch
#           that the fragment view made look unreachable.
#
# MERGED 2026-10-23 from 7 fragments (23E6, 2402, 240A, 2414, 241E, 241F, 2422) under the
# owner's split ruling. Body lines unchanged and in address order; asm_body_guard.py
# proves it.
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS
#   asm/4050_cmd_T does `cmp bl,0 ; jne 40C0` on the low byte of DI immediately after
#   calling here. Read as fragments, DI looked like a constant 31, which would have made
#   the map-tile path dead code -- yet the shop opened. It is not dead: DI is whatever this
#   scan left behind. Creature on the cursor -> DI = slot -> creature path. Nothing there
#   -> DI == 0 -> map-tile path.
#
# DOUBT -- read this before citing it
#   * The cursor is `player + DS:19/1A`, i.e. exactly ONE delta step from the player, and
#     the scan is an equality test against that single cell. So this is not a ray with a
#     reach; it is a one-cell probe. Any description of TRANSACT as "looking down a line"
#     is not supported by this routine.
#   * **What writes DS:19/1A from a direction is still unknown.** Every live sample reads
#     (1,1). Candidates examined and ruled out: asm/1086, asm/10AA, asm/10BF (they move
#     values to and from the per-entity arrays [DI+0x1F7]/[DI+0x217] via DS:25 -- not
#     keystrokes). asm/0B0F negates DS:19/1A in place (stc;cmc;sbb from zero), so it is a
#     sign flip that some caller could use, but it does not source a direction. asm/152E
#     sets them to player minus [DI+0x137]/[DI+0x157], i.e. a vector from a creature, also
#     not a keystroke. So four of the five static writers are accounted for and none of
#     them is the direction handler. Do not claim the probe is aimed by the direction key.
#   * The scan starts at slot 31 and stops when DI reaches 0, so **slot 0 is never
#     examined** -- `dec di ; jne` exits on reaching zero. Whether slot 0 can ever hold a
#     creature that should be found is not established here. In monx31 slot 0 is a Guard at
#     (29,30), so it is populated in at least one sector.
#   * Two `ret`s, not one: 241E (found) and 2422 (exhausted). That is why the merged span
#   * still grades as one routine -- the split rule requires the ret in the last row, and
#     both are in the last row here.
