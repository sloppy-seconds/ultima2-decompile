# cmd_W — command handler 'W' (WEAR ARMOUR): armour menu "WEAR ARMOUR:\r1-CLOTH,

#           errors " NOT OWNED!" and " <-THOU ART NOT\rSTRONG ENOUGH TO WEAR!";

# func 43F3..44D3  len 00E1 B  evidence: seed+reko (jump table cs:0730 entry W)
# provenance: live: cmd_W executed in captures/spice86/wonly/, observed 2026-10-26.
#           entry executed in 2 of 189 harvests; derived by tools/provenance_from_traces.py
#           The menu at 0x43F3/0x4445 and the success path at 0x44C0 are all present in that
#           harvest's ExecutedInstructions. The capture drove the whole success branch: with
#           DS:97 poked to 01 (own CLOTH) the digit `1` printed " READY." and DS:62 went 06 -> 01,
#           which is `mov 0x1f,%al ; mov %al,0x62` at 0x46CB landing exactly as decoded. The
#           NOT OWNED (0x4472) and strength-refusal (0x4493) branches were NOT taken and remain
#           static-only. Previously this line read "never appears in any of the 154 harvests", and
#           the D9 gate is what forced the correction rather than a silent edit.
#           All three exits tail-jump to L_000c33, the status tick — independent corroboration of
#           the input-path tick finding recorded in docs/phase4-state.md the same day.
# confidence: medium (flow + messages proven by bytes; NPC/quest semantics inferred)
# notes: re-decoded with tools/decode_str.py (str_out-aware); gas re-encode diffs
#        kept as .byte (disp8/disp16 and reg-op form choices)
