# item_slot_add_one — add 1 to one held-item count, slot given by %di
# name-evidence: bytes, whole function read (observed). Body is
#           `mov $0x0,%ah; mov %ax,%di; clc; mov 0xd6(%di),%al; adc $0x1,%al; daa;
#           mov %al,0xd6(%di)`. DS:D6+i is the held-item count array, 16 slots,
#           per docs/save-format.md (proven); the slot index arrives in AL and is
#           zero-extended into DI. Renamed from sub_2d07 on 2026-10-22 by
#           tools/bcd_census.py. No `call L_002f07` exists in asm/, so entry is
#           indirect and the game action is unproven; named for the arithmetic.
# label: kept as `sub_2d07` on purpose. CP0 (engine/tests/run_cp0.sh) pins every
#           non-comment line across a rename, so only the filename and the header
#           may carry a discovered name. Do not "tidy" the label to match.
# func 2D07..2D16  len 0010 B  evidence: seed+reko
# provenance: static:tools/bcd_census.py
# confidence: high for the arithmetic (16-byte whole function, no clamp, so a slot
#           wraps 99 -> 00); low for the caller and for which item %di selects.
# bulk wave: L_<addr> labels kept as cross-reference anchors (CP3)
