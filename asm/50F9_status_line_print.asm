# MERGED 2026-10-28d from 25 fragments the Phase 2/3 wave cut out of one routine: 5111 5112 5120 5121 5123 5124 5126 5129 513C 513D 514B 514C 514E 514F 5151 5152 5154 5167 5168 5175 5188 5189 5196 51A4. Body lines are concatenated in address order and none was edited; engine/tests/asm_body_guard.py requires the tree's assemblable content to be conserved, and it is.
# strings: "H.P.="
# body corrected: 2026-10-28e -- evidence: five instructions in this merged span were split by
#           the old fragment boundaries and shown as a forced-keep plus an invented mnemonic. The
#           bytes force the reading: `c0` always takes an imm8, so `c0 75 03` cannot end at 511D
#           or 5148; `bc` always takes an imm16, so `bc 02` cannot end at 5121. In each case the
#           byte the map cut on was an immediate, and the `stop-trunc call` markers on 5120, 5123,
#           514B and 514E invented calls to 0x55df and 0x53a5 that do not exist. The label lines
#           are all kept — only the `.byte` lines were merged — so the CP0 label invariant holds.
#           Found by tools/forced_keep_audit.py.
# calls: L_0051df (str_out)
# provenance: live:airport (+50 other harvests), static

#           confidence: low (bytes proven by check_func.py)
# REAL FUNCTION SPAN: runtime 50F9..51A4 — **25 fragments, one `ret` at asm/51A4**, the worst
#           split in the tree and now confirmed as one routine by `tools/fragment_splits.py`
#           on 2026-10-28d. It is the status-line printer: each field is a basic block that
#           positions the cursor (DS:2E/DS:2F), calls `str_out` with the label, then emits the
#           value. Four labelled fields on record — `H.P.=`, `FOOD=`, `EXP.=`, `GOLD=` — and
#           the run ends at asm/51A4's lone `ret`.
#           Why it fragmented so badly: most of the interior bytes are `reko`-only rows with no
#           seed, and the clean wave rendered them as forced-keep `.byte` lines or as nonsense
#           (`add %cl,0x521e(%bp,%si)` is not a real addressing mode here, it is a mis-decoded
#           immediate). So the fragment boundaries are artefacts of a decode failure, not of
#           control flow — which is the case to look for before proposing any merge here.
#           Do not merge from the TSV alone: read the span, and expect `asm_body_guard` to
#           object if the byte-for-byte content is not conserved.
# bulk wave: L_<addr> labels kept as cross-reference anchors (CP3)
