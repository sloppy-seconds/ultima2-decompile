# space_ship_erase — clear the rocket's on-screen sprite before it is redrawn
# name-evidence: the routine's ONLY callee is L_004daa (asm/4BAA_pixel_erase), and it calls
#           it thirteen times in two perpendicular sweeps centred on the ship's screen
#           position DS:47B (x) / DS:47C (y):
#               vertical stroke: x fixed at DS:47B, y from DS:47C-3 to DS:47C+2 (6 calls)
#               horizontal stroke: y fixed at DS:47C, x from DS:47B-3 to DS:47B+3 (7 calls)
#           i.e. it erases a plus/cross of pixels at the ship, which is exactly what you do
#           to a sprite's old position before drawing it at the new one. The paired DRAW is
#           asm/6B3D (L_006d3d), which calls pixel_plot L_004d76 as well as pixel_erase and
#           is reached from asm/6999's poll head; this one is erase-only.
#           It is called from asm/6999_space_status on every arrow arm and from
#           asm/6DFD_hyperwarp_flow's 'H' arm, each time immediately before DS:47B/47C are
#           reloaded with the next position -- so the order is erase-old, set-new, redraw.
# CORRECTS the framing in docs/handoff-2026-11-03.md § 3.5, which called this "the actual
#           space-movement routine" because every space arm calls it. That was an inference
#           from the call graph, and the bytes refute it: this routine writes NOTHING to DS
#           except the pixel-erase scratch DS:479/DS:47A, and moves no coordinate. The
#           movement is the caller changing DS:47B/47C; this is only the erase half of the
#           sprite update. Naming it "movement" would have been a wrong name on a real stub.
# func 6CC4..6D3D  len 007A B  evidence: call+reko
# calls: L_004daa
# provenance: live:g39-rocket-flight (+1 other harvest: g62h), static
# confidence: medium (the erase-only behaviour is settled by the single callee and the two
#           sweeps; the exact sprite shape depends on the disputed first three bytes below)
# body corrected: 2026-10-28e -- evidence: the first three bytes are the tail of
#           `or %ah,0x47b(%bx,%si)` (`08 a0 7b 04`) whose opcode is the forced-keep at
#           asm/6B3D; `mov 0x47b,%al` was those three bytes read as an instruction, and gas
#           encodes the `or` exactly, so the marker on 6B3D blames gas for a boundary.
#           Everything from 6CC7 was already aligned and is unchanged. Found by
#           tools/forced_keep_audit.py.
# bulk wave: L_<addr> labels kept as cross-reference anchors (CP3)
