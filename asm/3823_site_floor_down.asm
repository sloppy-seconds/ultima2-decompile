# site_floor_down — the decrement arm of the floor pair, and the only arm that can leave a site
# name-evidence: reached from two places and both are now known. asm/334D cmd_D jumps here when
#           the site kind is 4 (DESCEND in a tower goes down) and asm/37F1 cmd_K jumps here when
#           the kind is 5 (KLIMB in a dungeon goes up toward the surface). `decb 0x25` then `js`
#           is the whole rule: [DS:25] is a floor index and dropping below zero is how you get
#           out. The live witness is captures/spice86/d12-ladder-ds25, where DESCEND at floor 0
#           left the byte at 0xFF and put the player back on the world map. asm/3381 is the
#           mirror arm (`incb`, no bound check at all) and asm/3812 is the gate that picks.
# func 3823..38AF  len 008D B  evidence: reko; role read from the bytes 2026-10-29
# calls: L_000c33, L_002490, L_0051df (str_out), L_0052b3, L_0054ca, L_0055b5
# provenance: static bytes, corroborated live by captures/spice86/d12-ladder-ds25
# confidence: high for the floor arithmetic and the level message, both read directly off the
#           bytes, and the underflow outcome is observed.
#           LOW for the exit block at L_003a44. It restores the entry cell, clears the creature
#           slots through the [DS:272]/[DS:372] pair, zeroes the site kind, calls asm/2490, and
#           then branches on [DS:6D] between staging a cell from [DS:6A]/[DS:6B] and writing the
#           256-byte player record with an int-21h handle write. That last branch means leaving a
#           dungeon SAVES THE GAME, and it has never been observed. Dungeons are parked
#           (AGENTS.md § 3), so this block is recorded and not modelled.
# notes: L_0055b5 renders one packed-decimal byte as two ASCII digits, high nibble first, and
#           what it is handed comes from `add $0x0,%al ; daa` rather than a stored BCD byte — so
#           a floor past 99 prints a wrapped pair instead of a third digit. Do not "simplify"
#           that to a decimal format.
# label: sub_3823 / L_003a23 kept as they are — labels are body (AGENTS.md § 3).
