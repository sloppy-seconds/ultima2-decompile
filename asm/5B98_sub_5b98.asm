# 5B98_view_origin_wrapped — viewport origin for the WORLD MAP: origin, then `and $0x3f`
# name-evidence: reached only from asm/5AB1_view_origin_by_mode when DS:12 == 0xFF, i.e.
#           on the world map. `stc ; mov 0x1,%al ; cmc ; sbb $0x5,%al ; cmc ; and $0x3f,%al`
#           puts DS:03 at [DS:01] - 6 wrapped into 0..63, and the same shape with $0x9 puts
#           DS:02 at [DS:00] - 10 wrapped. The mask is the whole difference from
#           asm/5ABB_sub_5abb.asm, which computes the same two values unwrapped.
# This is the byte-level statement that the overworld is a torus at the viewport level, and
# that an interior sector is not -- which is the shape the engine's viewport-wrap fix
# reached for from the other end. See docs/monster-spawn.md § 15.2 and handoff item 6.
