"""bp_read.py — stop the CPU at a runtime address and dump guest memory there.

Why this exists
---------------
Several open questions are "what is the value of this operand at the instant the
game prints or charges it". Static reading cannot answer that (docs/commerce.md
§ 3 is the standing example: the price pair is written by a routine whose output
a static reader can only model), and polling cannot answer it either, because the
operand is scratch that the next caller overwrites.

The mechanism is Spice86's `monitor breakCsIp`, driven over the GDB remote
protocol by the same RSP class tools/reject_trap.py validated on 2026-10-22. This
module reuses that class rather than re-deriving it.

Two facts inherited from reject_trap.py and not renegotiated here:
  * `breakCsIp` parses its arguments as HEX while /api/status reports DECIMAL.
    The conversion goes through reject_trap.cs_ip_from_status, which asserts.
  * The trap is read-only with respect to guest memory: it never patches guest
    bytes, so it cannot damage the byte-exact comparison the project depends on.

Caller identification
---------------------
`--state`, `--ret` and `--callstack` ask the emulator, while the target is stopped,
who called us. They are **monitor commands on the GDB/RSP port** (20190); the HTTP
API has no equivalent — `GET /api/peekRet` answers an empty 200, which is not an
error and reads exactly like "no data".

  * `state`     -> registers, including SS:SP and DI
  * `peekRet`   -> the return address Spice86 finds on the emulated stack
  * `callStack` -> Spice86's whole tracked call stack (noisy, and its function
                   names are `unknown_CS_IP_linear`, so treat it as context only)

`--ret` also decodes the stack word at SS:SP itself and prints the two side by
side. They can disagree — `peekRet` reports what Spice86's call tracking believes,
the raw word reports what is in RAM — and a single number printed alone would hide
that. The offset is also converted to a **file offset** (`file = runtime + 0x200`,
see `tools/check_func.py` BIAS), because `asm/` files are named by runtime offset
and the two spaces have caused several false blockers.

**An RSP attach halts the VM.** Opening the gdb port pauses execution and it stays
paused when the socket closes without a `continue` — `/api/status` then reports
`isCpuRunning: true, isPaused: true` with a frozen cycle count, and every key sent
afterwards is swallowed. So this tool resumes on *every* exit path, including "no
stop within timeout", unless `--no-continue` was asked for.

Controls
--------
`--selftest` proves the mechanism against a live run in BOTH directions:
  positive  arm on the address the CPU is already executing -> must stop
  negative  arm on an address that can never execute        -> must NOT stop
A tool that can only ever report a hit is worthless here; the negative control is
what makes "no stop" mean something.

Usage
-----
    # arm, resume, and dump DS:27..2C when the tavern price print is reached
    python3 tools/bp_read.py --ip 17B7 --dump 27:6 --dump 4E:4 --timeout 90

    # who reaches the monster-spawn dispatch: registers, return address, call stack
    python3 tools/bp_read.py --ip 0D44 --cs 17D --state --ret --callstack --timeout 150

    # prove the tool can fail
    python3 tools/bp_read.py --selftest
