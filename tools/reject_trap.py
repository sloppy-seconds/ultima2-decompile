reject_trap.py — arm and detect the game's reject path, precisely and countably.

Item G0 of docs/needs-gameplay.md. The problem this solves
---------------------------------------------------------
A passability probe must tell three outcomes apart after sending a movement key:
the step MOVED, the step was REJECTED, or the keystroke was DROPPED. Position
alone cannot: a rejected step and a dropped key both leave the character where it
was. Conflating them is what invalidated the first passability sweep — nine
capture directories of confidently wrong terrain data.

The discriminator is the reject path itself. asm/0A02_invalid_move_msg prints
`--INVALID MOVE!`; tools/cfg_printed.py confirms that call genuinely executes on
rejected steps. Trap it and "rejected" stops being an inference.

Four things measured on 2026-10-22 that shaped this tool
-------------------------------------------------------
1. **`ExecutedInstructions` is a deduplicated address set, not a trace.** The
   reject offset appears exactly ONCE in every dump examined (mountain-walk,
   play-test-live, create-test-live), regardless of how many rejects occurred. So
   post-hoc per-step reject counting from existing dumps is impossible. The trap
   must be live.
2. **`DS:20` is not a reject signal.** engine/src/core/state.h says so explicitly
   ("Treat as scratch; do not use as a reject signal"). turn_recorder.py was
   using it and has been corrected.
3. **gdb(1) with a piped stdin emits nothing at all** — no banner, no prompt, no
   output — so a subprocess driver cannot tell whether anything happened, and a
   pty would be needed. Worse, `gdb -batch` cannot arm and wait anyway: the target
   is RUNNING on attach and gdb refuses `continue` with "Cannot execute this
   command while the target is running". So this module speaks the remote protocol
   directly. Four packet types is all it takes.
4. **`monitor breakCsIp` parses its arguments as HEX while /api/status reports
   DECIMAL.** Passing the API's decimal cs/ip silently arms a trap on an address
   that can never execute, and every subsequent "no reject observed" becomes
   meaningless. This is the single easiest way to get a confident wrong answer
   here, so the conversion is done in one place, below, and asserted.

Validated 2026-10-22: arming on the address the CPU was already executing returned
a stop (`TRAP FIRED: True`) with no gameplay involved — a positive control for the
mechanism itself.

Read-only with respect to guest memory: it uses the emulator's own breakCsIp and
never patches guest bytes, so it cannot corrupt the byte-exact comparison the
project depends on.
