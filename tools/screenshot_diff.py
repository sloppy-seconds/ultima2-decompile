"""screenshot_diff.py — CP4b T7: the standing "screenshots are tests" directive,
first attempt.

What it does, and what it deliberately does NOT:

  * Crops the DOSBox game area out of a play screenshot, downsamples to the
    CGA 320x200, and reduces every pixel to one of the four CGA colour classes
    (black / cyan / magenta / white) by nearest-neighbour in RGB. That yields a
    40x25 grid of colour classes, the same shape the engine's text grid has.
  * Renders the engine's status band headlessly (the same u2_status_draw the
    game uses) with a caller-supplied set of BCD values, and reduces it to the
    same 40x25 class grid.
  * Compares the STATUS-BLOCK region only (rows 20..23, cols 30..39), which is
    the one region whose content is fully determined by the BCD values we can
    set to match. The map region is out of scope: the screenshot and the engine
    are almost never standing in the same sector at the same position, so a
    whole-screen diff would measure that mismatch, not a defect.

This is a differential *harness*, not a pixel oracle. The acceptance the task
sets is that it runs in `make test` (PASS or SKIP with a named reason) and is
proven to catch a deliberately blanked band. The exact-match question (does the
original's status block read the same digits as our render) needs the BCD
values read out of the screenshot, which is OCR and is not attempted here —
guessing them would be the doubling-bug failure mode, so the tool takes them as
input and the test drives both sides from one source of truth.

Output is derived from a gitignored screenshot and never writes game content.
