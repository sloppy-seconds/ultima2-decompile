"""apple2_anchor_map.py — the Apple II <-> DOS string anchor crosswalk.

The DOS binary is a translation of the Apple II 6502 (docs/apple2-reference.md § 4). Where a
string appears verbatim on both sides, and in the same order inside the same cluster, the two
routines that print it are the same routine — and the 6502 around it is the specification the
8086 was translated from. That makes the Apple side a tiebreaker for *static ambiguity*
questions: which of two readings of a compare is right, whether a table is what we think.
It cannot prove anything about execution; see § 6 of that doc and the caveats in
docs/handoff-apple2-crosswalk.md.

Until now the anchor set was prose: "35 strings", ~10 clusters, not recoverable from the repo.
This tool makes it a measured, regenerable lookup.

    python3 tools/apple2_anchor_map.py --selftest     # controls; must pass
    python3 tools/apple2_anchor_map.py --summary      # counts and clusters
    python3 tools/apple2_anchor_map.py --tsv          # machine rows (no game text)
    python3 tools/apple2_anchor_map.py --show         # rows WITH text, stdout only
    python3 tools/apple2_anchor_map.py -o disasm/apple2-anchors.tsv

**No game text is ever written to a file.** `AGENTS.md`'s text line: copyright protects game
text exactly as much as a sprite, and `asm/` already carries every string the reconstruction
needs. A hand-maintained duplicate in `docs/` or a committed TSV adds drift *and* exposure.
So the committed artefact is offsets, lengths, segment names, match status and a short hash of
the normalised text — `--show` prints the text to stdout for a human and nothing else does.

How each side is found:

  * DOS: `tools/strings_atlas.py`, imported, not reimplemented (T2 constraint 3). That means
    every DOS string here has an owning `asm/` function and a `name-evidence` line attached,
    which a raw-exe scan would not give. It also means the DOS side is capped at what `asm/`
    renders as data: the middle `ANOS:` entries, for instance, sit in a region the clean wave
    emitted as instructions, so they are invisible here and their absence is a DOS-side gap,
    not an Apple-side miss.
  * Apple: the extracted BINs (docs/apple2-reference.md § 2-3), scanned per segment. A string
    is a run of bytes that are **all high-bit-set and printable once masked**, terminated by
    `$00`, with any trailing control wrappers (`0x0D`/`0x8D`/bell) trimmed. The high-bit rule
    is what keeps this a text scanner and not the "287 of 288 strings" artefact from § 6: a
    generic printable-run regex over the image catches double-hi-res bitmap noise and reports
    it as prose. Mask with `& 0x7F` and compare to the DOS text.

Order preservation is computed, not asserted: consecutive matches within CLUSTER_GAP bytes on
both sides form a cluster, and a cluster is *ordered* only if the Apple addresses rise in the
same sequence as the DOS offsets. That is the claim § 4 makes, and it is much stronger evidence
than set membership.
