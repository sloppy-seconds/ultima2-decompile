"""Turn-triggered recorder for a live Ultima II session.

Design, and why it is not a fixed-rate logger:

Ultima II is turn-based. The world advances only when the player acts or when
the idle auto-PASS fires, and every such turn changes food by exactly 19
(accepted move) or 10 (pass). Food is therefore a monotonic odometer of turns,
which gives two things a wall-clock logger cannot:

  * a change trigger, so snapshots land on turn boundaries rather than
    somewhere between them; and
  * a model check, because a food delta that is negative or cannot be written as
    19a + 10b means the model is wrong or a read was torn, and we say so instead
    of quietly recording a wrong history.

The odometer verdict is the FOOD MODEL only. It deliberately does NOT require the
per-sample move flag to agree with the decomposed move count: the game writes
player position and food non-atomically, so one accepted move can be sampled as
(delta=0, moved=True) on one poll and (delta=19, moved=False) on the next. That
split is a sampling artifact, not a lost turn or a model violation. Measured on
the 2026-10-21 castle-03 fight (3000 turns), re-derived 2026-10-22 directly from
the raw `turns/*.ds` blobs: of the 2999 consecutive-sample deltas, 2912 spent no
food at all (a rejected or idle step) and exactly 87 spent any, and every one of
those 87 spent exactly 19. Zero non-decomposable deltas.

Two accuracy notes, because the earlier wording invited a misreading:

  * "positive" here means food CONSUMED (previous minus current). Food itself
    falls; the raw readings are all decreases. A reader who took "positive" as
    "food went up" would conclude the opposite of what the bytes show.
  * No delta of 10 appears anywhere in this capture, so the 10/pass half of the
    model is UNEXERCISED by this data, not confirmed by it. The 19/move half is
    confirmed 87 times. Do not cite this capture as evidence for the pass cost.

All 76 prior "anomalies" were such split pairs or zero-cost rejects, i.e. the old
check was over-coupling food to a non-atomic position read.

Polling is fast on purpose: the memory API sustains 250 req/s at 0.3 ms with no
errors (measured 2026-10-21). The old 3 Hz limit belonged to the windowed CFG
view model, not to memory reads.

Each turn writes a raw snapshot (DS region + VGA) so any later tool can re-render
it, plus one JSONL index line with the derived facts.

Read-only against the emulator. Writes only under the output directory.
