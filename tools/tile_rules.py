tile_rules.py — does the substitute art conform to the rules the spec states?

Why this exists
---------------
Arts `13` and `14` were named from a guess about shape and the wrong noun got baked into
generated art and a legal record before anyone looked. The answer is not "look harder
next time", it is: when the owner states a requirement, encode it so the next redraw is
checked against the requirement instead of against nobody's memory.

THE ONE RULE THAT KEEPS THIS CLEANROOM-DEFENSIBLE
-------------------------------------------------
This checker verifies **conformance to a stated rule**, never similarity to the original
art. That distinction is the whole game:

* A rule is a *class* of patterns described in the abstract — "single-pixel dashes, ink
  confined to odd columns, inked rows periodic with period 4". Many different drawings
  satisfy it. Writing one is an act of authorship.
* A pixel diff against `tmp/tiles/` would be a copying mechanism wearing a lab coat. It
  would take the original's exact 32 coordinates as the target and reward whoever
  reproduced them, which is precisely what § 2 of the spec forbids and what this file
  must never become.

So: rules are authored from observation of *behaviour* ("a field of these must read as
one continuous wave, not per-tile static") and expressed as structure. The originals are
never an input here. `--src` reads only the cleanroom SVGs.

Pending ledger
--------------
A rule added before the art is redrawn would fail immediately, and a gate that is red
between "specified" and "redrawn" gets muted rather than fixed. So non-conformant tiles
listed in PENDING_REDRAW are reported as debt and do not fail the build. Any tile NOT in
the ledger that breaks its rule is a hard failure, and a pending tile that has quietly
become conformant is reported as ready to promote. Debt stays visible; regressions stay
red.
