# Xvfb + Spice86 (original Ultima II) + x11vnc + websockify, in one container.
#
# Shape follows deploy/novnc/entrypoint.sh (the engine container) on purpose, so the two
# are recognisably the same thing pointed at different binaries. Differences that matter:
#
#   * The run copy is made INSIDE the container, from the read-only /content mount. The
#     game rewrites its own `player` file, so it is never run in place — same rule the
#     host's tools/spice86_start.sh honours, enforced here by copying rather than by
#     convention.
#   * The CFG dump lands in /project/tmp/runs/<stamp>/dump, a host directory. Stopping the
#     container therefore leaves the harvest behind instead of losing it.
#   * Windowed mode, not --HeadlessMode: the point of this container is a person watching
#     and typing into the real emulator GUI over VNC.
#
# Deliberately supervisor-free. If Spice86 exits, everything exits and podman reports the
# container stopped, which is the honest signal.
