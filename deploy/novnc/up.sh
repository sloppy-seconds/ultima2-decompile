# Why this script exists at all, and why the verification steps are not optional.
#
# On 2026-10-29 an owner playtest came back as "you started the game with the cleanroom
# graphics, which I did not ask for". It was true. The deploy step was a chain of
# one-liners in which the build ran behind `>/dev/null 2>&1`, so a build that did not do
# what it was told produced no signal, and the binary that got copied into the image was
# not the binary the current source produces. Nothing between `make` and the running
# container looked at the artifact.
#
# So every stage here checks the ARTIFACT rather than trusting the step that produced it:
#   1. the build runs with its output visible and set -e in force,
#   2. the binary must be newer than every source file it is built from,
#   3. the binary is RUN and must announce the art mode it was asked for,
#   4. after the container starts, its own log must say the same thing.
# Step 3 is the one that matters: it catches a stale binary, a mis-set default, a wrong
# flag, or a build system that quietly did nothing, and it does so without caring which.
# A check that only proves the build exited 0 would have passed on 2026-10-29.
#
# A skip is reported as a skip and never as a pass. If there is no copy of the game to
# point at, or no saved character to boot into the world, the smoke test says so out loud
# and the script exits non-zero, because a deployment that shipped unverified art at a
# player is exactly the failure this file was written to stop.
